Beginnings of model theory

The main objective of model theory is to describe the model classes of
theories, 】Jıore precisely, the relationship between the nıodels of a theory on
the one hand, and that between tķe definable sets of a given model on the
other. We start, in Chapter 4, witĥ the most fundamental statement about
the existence of models, the ñniteness (or compactness) theorem. We deal
with immediate consequences in Chapter 5, where we also introduce our
main algebraic examples. In Chapter 6 we present Malcev's local theorems
of group theory of the early 40s, apparently the first non-trivial application
of nıodel theory altogether. In Chapter 7 we conclude this part with some
theory of orderings, ordinals, and cardinals.

Throughout we work in a ţanguage L-L (ơ), mnless it is ftaed oerwise.

Chapter 4
The finiteness theorem
In this chapter we prove the fundamental result saying that a set of sentences
has a model whenever every finite subset has a model.
4. 1 Filters and reduced products
Let us start with an example. Consider a family gi (i € N) of abelian
groups in the signature (0 +,-) (cf. §5. 2). ıret €ï be the abelian group
Hi € N gi. The support suppa of an element a of g iß, by definition, the set
{i€N : a(i)¢O}. ItiseaBytoseethattheset{a€G suppA isfinite}is
closed under addition and inverses and that it contains the neutral element
0l?. Hence this set is a substructure, that i8, a subgroup of g, which is
called the direct sum of the gi, in symbols ® iEM gi. In many cases, the
factor group Hi € N ţi / ® i € wgi is aJgebraically an interesting object. we
are interested in it, because it is a prototype for the general construction to
be presented here. Let'8 have a closer look at it.

two elements a-(ai : i € n) +@ien Çi and b-(bi : i e n) + ® i € n gi
of this factor group are equal if and only if the set supp (ai-bi i € N) =
{i € N ai ¢ bi} is finite, or, in other words, if ai-bi for all but finitely
many i € N. A subset of N is said to be cofinite if its complement in N is
finite. The set of all cofinite subseţs of N is called the ǳéchet filter (on
N). In tMs terminology, the above elements a and b are ewal if and only
if the set {i € N ai-bi} is contained in the Fchet Iilter. This leads to
the following generalization.

Given a direct product M = Hi € I Mi of arbitrary nonempty structures
indexed by a nonempty set I, we are going to define certain factor struc-
lures of M by way of identification of some of its elements. The memure

of identification will be given by certain subsets of the power set. of I, the
so-called filters, which we detine next.
Let I be a nonempty set. A nonempty subset F of its power set ţp (I) is
said to be a filter (on I) if the following conditions hold true. ]
(i) O+F

If A, B € F, then AnB € F.

(iii) If A € Fand ÅÇBÇI, thenB € F.

Since F + O, condition (iii) implies I € F.
If I is an infinite set, the cofinite subsets of I (i. e. The sets Å I whose
complement I \ A is fuute) constitute a filter on I, the so-called ĺéchet
filter on İ. For every B Ç I, the set F (B) =def {A Ç I : B Ē A} is a 61ter
on I, which is known as the filter generated by B. Filters generated by
a single element are said to be principal. For principal Iilters we simpluy
the above notation by omitting braces : given b € I, we write F (b) insteM of
F ({b}), Note that Iilters containing a singleton are automatically generated
by that singleton.

We now turn to the aforementioned factoring. For this, let I, Mi (i € I),
and M = Hi € Ni as before, in particular, M is not empty.
Given 1p € L. and an n-tuple iı in M, the set llp (ii) II-def {i e I : Mi
q (ā(i)) } is called the boolean extension of v (ii) ; here ñ (i) is a shorthand
for (oo (i),..  · tan-ı (i)), where łi = (ao,..., an-ı) and aj-(a, (i) : i € I)
with aj (i) E M ·

Remark. Suppose q, 1b € L.. And ã is an n-tuple in M.

(4) For all (n-1)-tuples ii in M and all b € M, we have llv(b, â) II Ç

llĵz q(£, ã) ll, and there is b € M such that llq(b, iı) lr = l13z v(T, ã) II.

Proof. (1), (2), (3), and the first half of (4) are immediate from the defini-
tion. For the other half of (4), choose b in M as follows.

For every i € l13r1p(a, ã) II pick ci in Mi such that Mi \p(ci, ã (i)), and
set b (i) = ci. For every j € I \ l13z1p(z, ā) II let b (j) be arbitrary in Mj ·

By choice of b, we have l13a p(a, â) II Ç llp(b, ã) n. D

To every filter F on I we can associate a relation-F on M by setting
a-F b if lla = blt E F. It is easily seen that this is an equivalence relation on

natural.

M. Given a € M, let a/F denote its equivalence class modulo rvp. Given
The reduced product M/F (or ni € 1 Mi/F) of the (nonempty) Mi
with respect to (or modulo) the ilter F is delined to be the following ı-
structure.
The universe of M/F is the set M/F of all equivalence classes a/F,
where a E M.

Given a constant symbol c € C, set /F_(dHi i € I)/F (i. e.,

Given an n-place relation symbol R € R and a tuple â in M, set
RM/F (â/F) just in case IIR (ä) II E F.
It is easily checked that these definitions do not depend on the choice of
representatives (exercisel). Thus the reduced product Hi € I Mi/F is well
defined by this.

If all the Mi are equal to a single structure N, the reduced product is
called reduced power of N with respect to F, in symbols"/ F.

Example. The factor group Hi € N gi/e i € N gi considered above is the re
duced product of the gi modulo the ħéchet {ilter on N.

Exercise 4. 1. 1. Verify that the definition of reduced product does not depend on
the representatives chosen.

Exercise 4. 1. 2. Show that every structure is embeddable in each of its reduced
powers.

Exercise 4. 1. 3. Let F be the ħéehet filter on N and N the standard model of
peano ǆithmetic. Prove that Ń N/F contains no pńme divisors, a and hence the
embedding from the previous exercise does not preserve prime divisors.

Exercise 4. 1. 4. Prove that every reduced power of a structure N modulo a prin-
eipal filter s isomorphic to a (direct) power of N.

4. 2 Ultrafilters and ultraproducts

spect to the satisfiability of formulas, as we will see now.

44 CHAPTER 4. THE FINITENESS THEOREM
Let I be a nonempty set, An ultrafilter on I is a ħlter F on / sucıI that
for all A Ç I, either A € F or I \ A € F. Reduced products (resp. powers)
modulo ultratilters are called ultraproducts (resp. ultrapowers).
Example. If I has at least two eıements (a and b, say), the singleton {i}
is a filter that is not an ultrafilter. The filter generated by {a, b} is not
an ultraĺilter either. Another example of a łilter that is not an ultrafilter
is the Fyéchet filter on an inlinite set. The filters generated by a singleton
(or just containing a singleton) are precisely the principal ultrafilters (exer-
cise!). Nonprincipal ultrafilters are harder to come by, for the ultrafilters are
precisely the maximal Iilters (exercise!). In general their existence rests on
Zorn's lemma (i. e. on the axiom of choice), see Lemma 4. 3. 1 below, whence
there is no constructive way of describing them (for more on this and the
connection with the compactness theorem see §6. 2 of Hodges'Model The-
ory). Note that every (ultra) filter on a set I is principal if and only if I is
linite (exercise!).

The next result is often called the fundamental theorem about ultra-
products.

Theorem 4. 2. 1. (Łoś [pronounce roughly like'wash'l l

Proof by inductioıı on the complexity of p ·

First of aı1 we have to show that tmlu(ã/u) = (N'(ã(i)) i € IllU
(hence im/u (ã/U) = N (ã)/U) for every term t () with n ħee variables
and every n-tuple ii from M. The proof of this goes by induction too, this
time on the complexity of the term t. We leave it to the reader.

Fkom this one easily derives that a term equation holds in M/U if and
only if its booıean extension lies in U similarly for relational atomic for-
mulǆ. Thus the assertion of the theorem is true for all atomic formulas

Let now , Øl, 2, and 0 be formulas satisfying the assertion of the
theorem (induction hypothesis). We are to show that also-, 1 A 2, and
3£ Q (a) satisfy this assertion.

(3) of §4. 1.

Hence one direction of the assertion follows from the (inite intersection
property (taking into account Remark (1) from §4. 1), while the other
follows from the extension axiom (iii) in the definition of filter.

N be the standard model of Peano arithmetic. Prove that Nm/U-contains elements
with infinitely many pńme divisors (cf. Exercise 4. 1. 3).

A positive primitive formula is a formula of the form 3Ē V : where V is a fuıite
conjunction of atomic formulas.

Exercise 4. 2. 4. Prove that Loś'theorem restricted to positive primitive formulǆ
V holds in arbitrary reduced products.

Exercise 4. 2. 5. Show that the ultrapowers of a structure N modulo a priïıcipal
ultralilter are isomorphic to N. [cf. 4. 1. 4 and 4. 2. 1. ]

4. 3 The finiteness theorem

We aheady mentioned that not everr {ilter is m ultrafilter and that, however,
every filter can be extended to an ultrafilter. We need the latter property
for our proof of the Iiniteness theorem, We prove a slight generalization of
it next, for which we make the following delinition.

Let I be a nonempty set. A subset F of (I) is said to have the fi-
nite intersection property if F + O and no intersection of finitely many
members of F is empty.

Remark. F has the Iinite intersection if and only if the set Fı of all finite
intersections of sets from F satis{ies the filter axioms (i) and (ii).

Lemma 4. 3. 1. Let I be a nonempiy set and F a subset of 3 (I) tıìith the
JiŊĮite intersection prope'Hg.

Then there is an uıtraftlter U on I containing F.

Gödel's corupleteness theorem for lirstnrder logic, which says that every logical
consequence can be derived in a certain eĦective formal proof system. The !initeness
theorem then follows immediately from the finite character of that proof system
('every formal proof is finite'!). Since it is model-theoretically irrelevant, we avoid
this proof theory and refer the reader to my of the standard logic texts for this.
