Structures

ıet us first look at some examples. By speciiying certain neutral elements
and operations, we may view the set 2a of integers ǆ an additive groupl as a
multiplicative semigroup, or as a ring. In the three cases given these would
be (0+), (1;·), or (0, l;+,  · ), respectively. We could also add the inverse
operation-or the ordering relation <. It is this choice of signature, as we
sayr that determines which structure on % we are dealing with.
1. 1 Signatures
A signature (T i8 a quadruple (C, F, R, a ı) consisting of a set C of constant
symbols, a set F of function symbols, a set R of reıation symbols, and
a signature function aı : F U R-> N \ {0}, where we assume the sets C,
F, and R to be pairwise disjoint. The elements of CuFuR are also known as
the non-logical symbols. For simplicity we often identify a signature with
its set of non-logical symbola. Accordingly, by the cardinality or power
of cr, in symbols lal, we simply mean the cardinality of the set C U F u R.
Unary relation symbols are also called predicates. A signature with C-O,
F = 0, or R = O is said to be without constants, without functions,
or without relations, respectively. A signature that has neither constants
nor functions, is called (purely) relational.

The signature function assigns to each symbol from F U R its arityt
i. e. İ € F i8 a d (f)-arr function symbol and R E R i8 a o '(R)-ary relation
symbol. Since a constant symbol e € C may be viewed as & (constant)
function with unique value c, we may think of c as a O-plane function. Ac-
cordingly the eignature function can be extended to all non-logicaı symbols
by setting d (c) = 0 for all c € C.

1. 2 Structures
Let a-(C, F, R, a') be a signature.
Giv en a set M, we may giv e o a'meaning'in AI by choosing elements
from AI and filnctions and relations on M which are to be denoted by
the non-logical symbols from a. Every such choice determines a 5o-called
structure of that signature on A  · 【, which assigns to each constant, function,
or relation symbol a well-defined interpretation in A  · I meeting the constraints
gi'A a-structure JH is a quadruple (AI, C  · v, Fm, R. w) consisting of an
arbitrary set AI (the underlying set or universe of M), families C. V_
(cv : c € C), F-'H_u. v f € F), and R. v_(R. v R € R), where
Gv € M for all c € C,. f.'H is a a'(f)-ary function from AI to Af for all
f € F, and Rjv is a cr'(R)-ary relation on M (hence a subset of AP'([t)) for
all R € R. The cardinality or power lm of a cr-structure M is simpl!  ·
the cardinality lm of the underlying set, Af. For P, a non-logical symbol
from cr, the object P. v is said to be the interpretation of P in JH. Given
a signature cr without constants, . Is used to denote the empty a-structure.

Note that empty a-structures exist precisely when C is empty, $. e. when
cr is 11'ithout constants.

The notation for structures follows the guidelines fixed-for signatures
in the previous subsection. Further, if R € R is an n-ary relation sym-
bol and (ao,..., a7z-1 ) € RM we also write R. M (Qo,... Tart-1 ) or even
N F R(ao,..., an-1), this referring to the satisfaction relation to be defined
below. In case of an Tt-place function f, we write f. V (ao,..., aTz-1) = b or
M F f(ao,..., an-1) = b, accordingly. As usual, tuples are denoted e. g. By
; writing f (d) or R (a) then tacitly assumes f and R to hav e the arity cor-
responding to the length of .

Example. Consider a-(0, 1, +,., <), where a'(+)-.'( · ) = a'(<) = 2.
Every ordered ring 71 (see §5, 5 below) can be regar ded as a a-structure
(R 072, 1l; +71,. 71; <7Z), where the non-logical symbols from o are inter-
preted by the corresponding constants, functions, and relations, respectively.

Then, for example, 71 0 < 1 or, equivalently, OÌz <n 1l.

Exercise 1. 2. 1. Find a signature appropriate for the description of vector spwes
over a given field /c.

1. 3 Homomorphisms
In order to compare two o-structures M and N we need maps between them
that preserve certain features of these structures.

A homomorphism from M to N is a map h : M 4 N satisfying
(i) h (cM) = ¢V, for alle € C,
all aor  ·  ·  · , an-1 € M, and all f € F with cr'(f) = n,
all ao,..., an-1 € M, and all R € R with cr'iR)-n.
We write h : MĦNfor short.
\ 4

The structure JV is a (strong) homomorphic image of the structure
M if there is a (strong) homomorphism from M onto JV.

SinĮ the n ıtation h[(ao,...,. An-1) ] = (h (ao),..., h(a.-1)) from the list
before Chapter 1, we can rewrite (ii) and (iii) more concisely as follows.
(ii') fN (h[ã]) = h (fm(ã)) for all f € F and ã € M°'(n,
(iii') Rm (ã) R N (n[ã]) for all R € R and ã € Ma'(R).
An isomorphisnı from M toN (or between M andM is, by definition,-
a surjective monomorphism from M onto N. We rrite h : M N if h is
such an isomorphism. If h fixes a set X Ç M n N pointwise (i. e. h extends
the map idx), we wTite h M X JV and speak of an isomorphism over
X or just an X-isomorphism. The structures M and N are said to be
onıorphic (over X), and JV is called an isomorphic image of M (over

M N (or M g. ť )v) is used to indicate this. An isomorphism type of

Isomorphic structures have of course the same cardinality.

Warning. A bijective homomorphism need not be an ¡somorphism!

Example. Consider two sets M and N of the same power and a signature
cr that consists of a unique predicate symbol R only, Tbrn these sets into
cr-structures M and N by setting Rm_O and RN_N. Any bijection
h : M 4 Ar is clearly a homomorphism but not a strong one, hence it cannot
be an isomorphism.
Remark. In case R = O, any bijective homomorphism is already an iso-
morphism, since then every homomorphism is strong.

jectįon.

Remark. Let M and JV be ü-structures.

Then h : M Ħ N is an isomorphism if and only if there is h': JV M

An endomorphism of JH is, by definition, a homomorphism from M
to itself. The endomorphisms of M form-with respect to composition of
nıaps-semigroup (see §5. 2 below) whose identity element is idM. An
automorphism of M is an isomorphism of M onto itself. Given X C M,
an X-isomorphism from M onto itself is called automorphism over X  ·
or just X-automorphism of M. The automorphisms of M form a group
with respect to composition of maps, the so-called automorphism group
of M, denoted by Aut M. Given X C M, AutxM denotes the subgroup
formed by the X-automorphisms. A monomorphism h : M JV is also
called isomorphic embedding of M in JV (cf. The end of §1. 4 below). In

embeddable (over X) in Aí, ıf there is an embeddinB (over X) of M in Ń.
We then wTite M N (resp. Jvı X N).
Thus every automorplıism is a surjective and injective endomorphism,
and again, the converse need not be true (check!).
As in group theory or other al8ebraic theories known to the reader, every homæ
mo 中 hic image of a structure M is (isomorphic to) a factor structure of M moduıo
a congruence nlation on M. In order to have a 1-1 correspondence between the
isomorphism types of homomorphic images and factor structures, one needs to r
strict oneself to strong homomorphisms (which, of couree, is irrelevant if there are
no. Reıation symbols around). See §2. 4 of Malcev's Algebraic Systems for this.
Exercise 1. 3. 1. Given X Ė M, let Aut{×}M be theset{h € AutM : h[×] = X}.
Show that AutxM is a normal subgroup of Aut{×}M. What happens if, instead
of h[×] = X, we require only h[×] ç X?
-Exercise 1. 3. 2. Find a structure with a bijective endomorphism that is not an
automorphism.

Exercise 1. 3. 3. Find an infinite structure M with a trivial automorphism group,
i. e. Aut M-{idM }.

1. 4 Restrictions onto subsets
Often one wants to think of a subset of a given structure as a structure of
the same signature, in its own right. This is possible only if the subset meets
the following requirement.

ııet M = (M, Cm, Fm, Rm) be a cr-structure and N a subset of M.
We say N is closed in M under ħinctioıH'(from a) if cm Ė N and
FM[N] ÇN (i. e., € N, for alle € C, md fm (ã) € N, for allfEF
and all cT'(f)-tuples ã in N). If this i6 the case, we can turn N into a a-
structure N by setting dv = d\«, İN (ā) = fm (ă), and R"(8) precisely if
Rm (b), for all c € C, all f € F, and all d (f)-tuples ã om N, as well as all
R € R and all d (R)-tuples b from N.

Remark. If the signature of M i5 purely relational, i. e. C-F_O, euery
subset N C M can be made such a uniquely determined structure N. If
the signature of M is without constants, i. e. C-O, the empty set can be
made such a structure (isomorphic to 0. From §1. 2).

'This terminology is justified by the aforementioned fact that constants can be regarded
as nullary functions.

1. 5 Reductions onto subsignatures
We obtain a diñcrcnt kind of (xīrıonical structure, if, instead of slırinking the
uniuerse, we make the, signatTt?'e smaller and just'forget'thc interpretation
of the symbols left out from tlıe signahrre. As in the preceding section, we
consider also the reverse process-whicłı is no longer canonical where we
have to assign interpretations to syınbols added to the signature.

Let ao and nl be signatures such that o Ç o1 (i. e. with Co Ē Cl,
Fo Ç Fı, Ro Ç Rı, and n = a{ r dom a6). Then every n1-stnıcture JV
can be canonically regarded as a ao-structure. More precisely, the reduct
of M onto oo (or thc oo-reduct ol M) is the strmture M r (To-def
(M, Cy, FP, RP) (where cy = {C c € Co} and similarly for FP
and np). Given a no-stmcture N and a o1-structure M, tlıe structure M
is said to be ail expansion of the structure N Lo o11 if N is the reduct of

M onto ao ·
The relationship hetwecn these concepts is illustrated by the following.

1. 6 Products

Here we see how one caıı, in a canonical way, patch various structures to-
gether, provided all of them have the same signattıre.

Let I be a nonempty set and (Mi i € I) a family of a-structures. We
define the direct (or cartesian) product M = ni € ı M¢ of this family to
be the following cr-structure M. The universe M of M is the set of all maps
a : I_Ui € ı Mi that have the property that a (i) € M for all i € I. We
often write a as (a (i) : i € I).

Given c € C, we let dų be the element a € M for which a (i) = cMI for
alli € I.
Given an n-place function symbol f € F and a tupıe ii = (ao,..., an-1)
from M, we let 1 M (ä) be the element b € M such that, for all i € I, we

Given an n-place relation symbol R E R and a tuple ii = (ao,..., an-1)
from M, set Rm (ā) in case RMI (ao (i),... Tan-1 (i)) holds for all i E I.

ĺbr Hi« n Mi we also write Mo x... x Mn-1. Given i € I, the structure
Mi is called the ith (direct) factor of the direct product JV. 1f Mi-N
for all i € I, the product HiEI Mi is also called Ith direct power of N, in
symbols Nı.

Remark. The axiom of choice ensures that Hi € I Mi ¢ O if none of the Mi
is empty. (In case I is finite, the axiom of choice is not necessary for this.)

In connection with the above direct product we have the following canon-
ical homomorphisms.

Given j € I, the map pj : Hi € I Mt 니 Mj denned by pj (a) = a (j) is, by
definition, the projection onto the jth factor.

Remark. Any such projection pj is a homomorphism of M-Hi € I Mi to
Mj, which is surjective if )H # 0.

Exercise 1. 6. 1. Show that M = Hi € ı Mi is uncountable as soon, as no Mi is
empty and infinitely many of the Mi have at least two elements.
