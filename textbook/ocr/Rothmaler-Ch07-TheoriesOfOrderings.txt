Chapter 7
Some theory of orderıngs
This chapter contains various fundamental order-theoretic topics. The first
one is a modification of the previous chapter's diagram method.
7. 1 Positive diagrams

The positive diagram D+ (M) of an structure M is defined to be the
set of all atomic L (M)-sentences satisfied in (M, M).

Remark.
D (M) = D+ (M) U {-q (ã) : q € L is atomic, ã in M, p (ii) ¢ D+ (M) }  ·
As in Exercise 6. 1. 5, it suffices to consider unnested sentences v (exercise!).
Example. The positive diagram of a group is fup to TG-equivalence) its
Cayley diagranı (i. e. Its multiplication table).

As an analogue of Lemma 6. 1, 2 we have

Lemma 7. 1. 1. (The Positive Diagram Lemma) Suppose M and JV ane L-
stmchıres.
(n If h M 4 N, en h M 4 N įf and onl if h M N, if and onįy
if uv, h[M]) D+ (M).

L2) There is a homomoTphisTn M 4 JV įf and onıy if N has an erpansįon

which is a rnodel olD+ (M).

second is obvious (for the given map h).

7. 2 + The theorem of Mar czewski-Szpilrajn
This theorem is a neat application of positive diagrams.
Theorem 7. 2. 1. Any partial order on a set A ca?ı be extended to a linear
order on A.

ISzpilrajn, E. : Sur I'extension de I'ordre partiel, Fhndamenta ħīath. 16 (1930) 386
389] (Thc author later published under the name E. Marczewski.)

Proof. Let A = (A, ) be a partial ordering (regarded as an L«-structure).
As a first step we reduce the result to finite orderings,

If (B, {b. : a € A}, <) i5 a model of

E = D+ (A) UĽOU {Q¢b : a, b € A, a+ b}

and if ß is its L«-reduct, then h (a) = b. Defines, by Lemma 7. 1. 1, a ho-
momorphism h : A'_B, which is obviously an embedding. In particular, h
respects the ordering, i. e.,
ľ1 abą hla) く h (b).

As ı3 i5 a linear ordering, so is h (A) Ç B. Since h is a bijection between
A and hlA], we therefore obtain a linear ordering of A on setting a < b if
h (a) < h (b), for any a, b € A. By ( · ), the order < extends the partial order
on A.

Thus it remains to prove that E i5 consistent, So let Eo be a finite
subset of E and let ao,..., an-1 be thc new constants occurring in Eo ·
Then Eo C D+({ao,..., an-1}, A U LO U{ai aj i < j < n}. If I1ow, on
{ao,... Tan-l}, the partia, 1 order can be extended to a linear order (on
{ao,..., arz-1 }), we get a model of Eo, and are done.

Thus we have reduced the theorem to finite partial orderings and we are
left witlı 口

({ao.... \un-1}, <). Then < u{(ai, a.) i < ?ı} is a linear ordering on
{ao,..., a.. } extending . D
Another proof of the preceding lemma is the following. 1
Exercise 7. 2. 1. Define recursively a rank function r from a finite partial ordering
A = (. 4, ) to N by setting r (a) = 0 for every <-minimal element a in A, and
setting ribi = 1 for every -minimal element b in A \ {a € A : r (a) = 0}, and so
forth.

Use this to extend to a linear order on A.

A partially ordered group ((, <) is said to be orderable if < can be extended
to a linear ordering of the group Ç (in the sense of §5. 5). g is called orderable if
there is some linear ordering of the group Ç, while i is called freely orderable if
every partial order of the group (i can be extended to a linear order of .
Exercise 7. 2. 2. Prove the following local theorems.

(a) A partially ordered group (Ç, <) is orderable if and only if (Ço, <) is orderable
for every linitely generated subgroup go of g.

(b) A group is orderable if and only if it is locaJly orderable.
(c) A group is freely orderable if and only if it is so locally.

Exercise 7. 2. 3. An abelian group is orderable if and only if it is torsionfree.
7. 3 Cantor 9 s theorem

As early as at the end of the 19th century Georg Cantor discovered an
important feature of countable dense linear orderings.

of mathematics. 2 Wc present this material as part of our model-theoretic
treatment of orderings ; wc will add il, however, to our set-theorclic tools on
the metalevel, i. e. iui part of our methods of proof. As usual in most i»nrts
of mathematics, we ha \ rn't fonnally outlirıcd or precisely fixed the latter,
but rather made use of some sort of naive set theory (including the axiom
of choice). Ho \ ưever, in order to justify the method of translinite incluc-
tion. which we will need ıater, we are forced to be soınewhat more precise
in our set-theoretic setting. (Nevertheless, we will remain on a quite naive
level and refer the interested reader to the cited set-theoretic literature for
a more mature treatïnent.)

Usually one works in a realm of pure sets, i. e. sets whose elements are
sets again (as opposed to so-called urelements). This realm can be thought
of as a huge'structure'V whose signature has only one symbol, the binary
relation symbol €. This is not a structure in the formal sense of Chapter 1,
as its universe is not a set anymore (it is too big). However, besides that
it looks just like a usual structure. Fbrther, one assumes that V satisfy
the so-called Zermelo-ħtıenkel azioms ZF and, with the exception of a few

philosophically concerned mathematicians, also the aziom of choice, AC,
which, altogether, form the axioms ZFC. the elements of V are the sets,
and the axioms of ZFC control which ° composites'of these are to be sets
(i. e. Elements of V) again. In general, those'composites'are classes. Thus
some of the classes are sets. But not all of them are an example of such a
proper class, as one says, is (which is noţ an element of itself). Other
examples are isomorphism types of arbitrary nonempty structures. The
underlying idea for the distinction of sets among the classes is that sets
are ° smalľ classes. Thus it is natural to assume that finite classes are sets
and that a subclass of a set is a set again. These are essentially two of the
Zermelo-Oaenke1 aJcioms. We will mention more when we need them in the
course of our arguments.

To make our model theory part of such a set-theoretic setting, as the rest
of mathematics, we included in the concept of ° structure'that the collection
of all its elements be a set (cf. §1. 2), i. e. An element of V. As mentioned
before, (V, €) is not a structure in this sense. It is no problem, however,
to extend the notion of structure to mbitrary classes by simply dropping
this requirement. In this way one obtains'big structures'_like (N, €). In
order to have the previous material at our disposal we allow such structures
in the remainder of this chapter. For instance, by a partial ordering we

its sectiolrs is a set.
Clearly, any section is a segment,. Furt, hcr, any proper segment, of a
narrow linear ordering (X, <) is contained in a section and is t, hus a set.
Consequently, if (X, <) is narrow, but not itself a set, then X is t, he only
segment of (_K, <) that is not a set. In particular, X cannot be a section,
which means that (X, <) has no greatest element.

A well-ordering is, by detinition, a nal. Row linear ordering in which
every nonempty subclass has a least element, I. e. An element that is smaller
than or equal to all ele】T1ents in that subclass. A well-ordering which itself
is a set is simply called a well-ordered set. A well-ordered set obviously
is narrow, Note furt. Her that any well-ordering is a linear ordering (consider
any tw o-element subset).

Recall that our orderings are strict (I. e. Irreflexive), hence homomor-
phisms of linear orderings are automatically monomorphisms.

Examples. (1) Every finite linear ordering is a well-ordered set.

(2) The ordering of the natural numbers (I. e. The usual ordering on N ) is

a Mell-orde].ed set.

Remarks. (1) Every subordering of a well-ordering is a well-ordering, and

every proper segment of a well-ordering is a well-ordered sct.
(2) A narrow linear ordering is a well-ordering if and only if it is well-

founded in the sense that it cont, ain no infinite descending chain of
elements ao > al > a2 >... > an >
(3) The empty set is a segment of every linear or dering. Since every well-

ordering has a smallest element, the empty set even is a section in every
well-ordering.
(4) Any segment of a well-orclering (X, <) is a section or the entire class
X.
(5) Every well-ordering is isomorphic (as an ordering) to the class of all of

its sections ordered by set inclusion.

proof Otherwise there would be a least element a € X not having the
property p, hence the condition (a) would be violated. D
While the induction principle constitutes the fundamental method of
proof by transfinite induction, there is a similar fundamental tool for the
constmncłion of functions on well-orderings, the so-called recursion principle.
Applications of the recursion principle are also known ǆ definitions by
transfinite induction. They typically look as follows.

We are given a well-ordering (X, <), an arbitrary class W, and a re-
cursive condition F by which we are to successively define a function
f : X->W, that is, this condition says how ţo extend an already con-
structed 1. : 니 W to a € X. Finally one delines f to be the union
of all the j.. The recursive condition F thus has to be a function assigning,
to every function from a section X. (of X) to W, a value f (a) € W of a.
That is, if j. : -> W has been already constructed, we set f (a) = F (J.)
(and thus obtain a'larger'function İb : Xb-> W, say, where b is the least
element of X \ X.).

for all 9, lt € F, we have 9 ç h or h ç g (where, as usual in set theory,
we identify a function with its graph).
For a proof, pick g € Ť n ï. and lt € Ť n ï.. where a < c. We claim that
g-h r X. (hence g C h). If not, there would be a leaßt b < a in X with
9 (b) h (b). Then we would have 9 r Xb-h r Xb and hence, by the choice
of ï, also g (b) = F(ý r Xb) = F(h r Xb) = h (b). This contradiction proves
Thus F forms a chain with respect to set inclusion. Hence, its union 

U F is a function, J", whose domain is either all of X or a section thereof.
In the former case we are done, for the function f'clearly satis{ies the

recursive condition on its domain. Assume therefore that dom f'is a section,
X. say, for some a E X. Then ï is in F n F.. Let f be the function

this latter function satislies the recursive condition on dom f-X. u {  · },
If there were some b > a in X, we would have f € Fb n î for the smallest
such b, hence also f C I'. This would imply a € dom J", contradicting the

In the next section we will specify these principles to ordinai numbers.

7. 5 0rdinai numbers and transfinite induction

We now investigate sets partially ordered by the element relation €. In
particular, on such sets the relation € is transitive. In set theory there is
another important concept of transitiv ity : a class X is said to be transitive
if × € y € X implies x € X.

Remarks.
(1) The following are equivalent for any class X.

(I) X is transitive.
(ii) T E X implies x C X.
(iii) Y C X implies U Y £ X.

Proof (I) + (ii) is clear.

(iii) means that y € Y implies y X, provided Y C X. This, however,
is immediate from (ii).

Conversely, (ii) is the special case Y-{  · } of (iii). D

TYivially, X is the greatest element with respect to € in X u {X} (for
x E X implies z € X). The transition from X to X U {X} plays a particular
role in what follows.

Lemma 7. 5. 1. Suppose X S a transitiue set om whi ch the element relatiort
lows a partal (T'esp. a tuell-) or  · dering.

Then the same is true Jor X U {X}.

Let € be, in łtddition, transitive on x. We show it, is so also on Xu{×}.
For this, let x, y, z € X U {X} wiŁh × € y € z. If x, y, z are all in X, then
T € z follows from the transitivity of € on X. It is easily seen from X ¢ X
and the transitivity of X that otherwise z € y € z-X, hence x € z. D
An ordinai number (or just an ordinai) is, by definition, a transi-
tive set on which the element relation € forms a well-ordering (and is, in
particular, irreflexive). We denote the class of all ordinai numbers by On.

(Their name stems from the fact that the ordinals represent the order
types of well-ordered sets, see Theorem 7. 5. 6 below.)

Remarks.
(2) There is no inĥnite descending chain of ordinai numbers ao al 3

cr2 Ĵ... (cf. Remark (2) in §7. 4).

(3) Intersections of ordinai numbers are ordinai numbers.

(4) The previous lemma shows that if a is an ordinai, so is a u {  · }. (Here

we used that by the Zermelo-Fyaenkel axioms a u {a} is a set again.)
(5) Every transitive subset of an ordinai is an ordinai.
(6) Every element of an ordinai is an ordinai.

(7) The union of a clms (resp. of a set) of transitive sets is a transitive

class (resp. a transitive set).

Proof. Ad (6). Let a € On and z € a, hence also z C a. By (5) we need
only show that z is a transitive set. So let Æ € 3/€ z. By the transitivity of
a, we have x € y € a and hence Æ € a. Consequently, T, y, z € a and the
transitivity of € on a implies T € z, as desired.

Ad (7). Let each € X be transitive. Using (1) (ii) above we show that
U X is transitive. So let y E U X. Then y € × for some Æ € X. Now the
transitivity of z yields y C , hence also y C U X.

Finally, if X is a set all of whose elements are sets then, by the axioms
of set theory, also U X is a seţ. D

We will see shortly that also unions of arbitrary sets of ordinals as well
as transitive sets of ordinals are themselves ordinals.
The simplest ordinai is the empty set 0. Starting from this and using (4)
we obtain infinitely many ordinals. Given an ordinai a, we denote by a + 1
the ordinai a U {  · }. Fbrther, we write

Fther, we write

etc.

If ô € 7, the transitivity of P yields õ € P. Together with the minimality
of 7 this implies ô € a. Hence 7 C a.

To show that also a Ç 7 let 6 € a (C P). Since € orders the set ß
linearly, ô and 7 are comparable with respect to €. Thus 7 € ô, 7-ô, or

transitivity of a). As this would contradict the choice of , we must have

we have a n P = a or a n P € a. This yields four cases to consider, a = ß,
P € a, a € ß, or, as the fourth case, anp € ß and anp € a. But the
fourth case is impossible, for a n P € a and a n P € a n ß contradict the
irreHexivity of € on a € On.

Finally, irreflexivity and antisymmetry (of € on On) guarantee that no
two of the remaining cases can take place simultaneously. D

Thus thť ordinai numbers form an infinite ascencling chain (On, <) with
respťct to < (which, for ordinals, is the same ǆ the element relation € or
the inclusion c). This chain (On, <) contains no infinite descending chains.
We will sec shortly that it evell is a well-ordering.
As suggested by the notation, a + 1 is the immediate successor of a : if
(ł < J3 (hence a € /ĵ and a C O), then au{°} C P, i. e., a+ 1 Ś . Starting
from O, which obviously is the smallest, ordinai (for O is contained in every
ordinai), we thus obtain the ascending chain 0 < 1 < 2 < 3 <... < u <
+ 1 < (ł) + 2 <... 1 which constitutes an initial segment of the chain of all
ordinals, (On, <). h  · lore generally we have

100 CHAPTER 7. SOME THEORY OF ORDER1NGS
The reforruulation of the recursion principle for ordinals is left to the
reader. Instead «re want to derive the aforementioned correspondence be-
tween ordinals and isomorphism types of well-orderings (also called well-
order types). More precisely, we are going to show that every well-order
type contains exactly one ordinai. This enables us to transfer the transfi-
nite induction ǆ specified to ordinals to arbitrary sets : by the well-ordering
principle every set can be well-ordered and is then, by the theorem below,
isomorphic to an ordinai. This means nothing more than that every set X
can be indexed by an ordinai number a, i. e., X = {×Q ß < a}. Then
statements about the elements of X can be proved by induction on ß < a.

Any two ordinals are comparable. Hence, if they are different, by Lemma
7. 5. 3 (1), the smaller one of them must be a section of the other. Then
Lemma 7, 4. 1 (2) implies that they cannot be isomorphic. Thus every well-
order type contains at most one ordinai, In order to show that every well-
order type does contain an ordinai we need the following

LeHıma 7. 5. 5. Suppose IX, <) įs a 1ueıį-ordeTing anď l X On is 51ıeh
that the ordering (X.. «l is įsomowhįc to the ordįnal î (a) lor euertl a € X.

Then İ is an order isomorphįsm Jrom Lx, <) onto an initial segmerıt oĵ
ŁOn, <). Further, AXl = On įl and only f X is ınot a set.

Proof The map f is an embedding of (X, <) in (On, <), for c < b iff
X. c Xb iff f (c) is isomorphic (hence equal) to a section of f (b).

We claim that f[×] is an initial segment of (On, <). This is trivially
true in case f[×] = On. If this is not the case, tliere is a leǆt element Q in
On \ f[×]. We show that B = f[×] (and hence (X, <) is isomorphic to ).
By the minimal choice of P, we have C f[×]. If there were a > Ď in f[×],
there would be also a € X with f (a) = a, The isomorphism a (X.. <)
would then yield b € X. with Q (Xb, <) (for ß is a section of a). Then
we would obtain ¢ f (b), hence also /ĵ = f (b), contradicting the choice of
P. Thus, in any case, f[×] is a segment of (On, <), as required for the first
assertion of the lemma.

The set-theoretic aziom of replocement says that, given a function f and
a set X, also f[×] is a set. Since f is a bijection onto f[×], it has an inverse,
and so the replacement axiom yields that X is a set if and only if so is f[×] ·
As On is not a set while each of its sections is, the second assertion follows
as well D

Theorem 7. 5. 6. Euery u) eıl-ordered set is įsomowhic to a tıïıįque ordirıal
number. EUer'well-ordering that is not a set ts isomowhic to (On, <).

proof. First we shcıw that every well-ordered set (X, <) is isomorphic to a
proper initial segment of (On, <), i. e. To an ordinai. If this were not the case,
the preceding lemma would yield (ı in X such tlıat X. is not isomorphic to
an ordinai. But then eveı  · y section of Xa would be isomorphic to an ordinai,
contradicting this lemma.

Thus every section of a well-ordering is isomorphic to a unique ordinai.
If now (X, <) is an arbitrary well-ordering, we may ǆsign to every a € X a
(uniquely determined) ordinai f (a) X.. The resulting function f : X 4
On then satisfies the above lemma, which implies the assertions. D

Corollary 7. 5. 7. Giuen tı】ell-orders X and y, the tı】ell-oTďeri?ıg X is iso-
mowhic to an inįtįal segment ol y, or y is įsomowhįc to an initįaį segment
oĵ X. (In any mse, one of them is embeďtitlble in the other.) D
Cantor, who introduced the ordinai numbers, defined them as well-order types
(and he didn't bother ţo give a precise seţ-theoretic justification for their existence).
fn contrast, John von Neumann defined them as particular well-ordered sets. We
followed the latter's apparently more ar 七 ificial way, as it is more elegant and set-
theoretically precise. The theorem just proved, however, shows that the two well-
ordered clǆses, (On, <) on the one hand and the class of well-order types with
the order given by inclusion of corresponding representatives on the other, are
isomorphic. In this sense the two definitions-von Neumann's and Cantor's original
onhare equivalent.

Exercise 7. 5. 3. Show that tlıc complete L<-tllcory of any infinite ordinai nmnber
has a noıl-well-founded motlcl, i. e. a model that is not well-ordered.
7. 6 Cardinal numbers
Recall that two sets have the same potıter (or cardinalżty) if there is a bi-
jection between them. The relation of having the same power is easily seen
to be an equivalence relation on the universe of sets. Similarly ǆ well-order
types (i. e, equivalence clǆses of well-orderings modulo isomorphism) con-
tain as a particular representative an ordinai number, we see next that also
the equivalence classes of sets with respect to having the same power contain
as a representative a particular kind of number, a so-called cardinal number.
This will allow us to speak of the cardinality of a set-as a set-theoretic
object (ǆ opposed to just having around an equivalence relation of having
the same power).
Namely, we define a cardinal number (or just a cardinal) to be an
ordinai that has not the same power as any smaller ordinai (i. e. There
is no bijection onto a smaller ordinai). In other words, a cardinal is the
smallest ordinai in the clms of all sets of the same cardinality. For this
reason cardinals are also known as initial (ordinai) numbers. We denote
the class of all cardinal numbers by Cn.
Example. Obviously, finite ordinals are cardinals (since no finite set can
be bijectively mapped onto a proper subset). Thus all natural numbers are
cardinals. Clearly, also u) is a cardinal. However, u + 1 is not a cardinal, for
+ 1 and u have the same power.
Recall the well-ordering principle (from the remar k at the end of §7. 4)
that says that every set, A has an ordering < making (A, <) a well-ordered
set A and hence isomorphic to an ordinai. The smallest thus occurring
ordinai is defined to be the cardinality of A, in symbols IAI. Clearly, IAI
is a cardinal.
Being a subclass, Cn inherits various features fr om On, first of all the
ordering, which is a well-ordering also on Cn. Then, being an ordinai,
every cardinal is equal to the set of all smaller ordinals, i. e., to the set
of all ordinals of smaller cardinality. Fbrther, by Theorem 7. 5. 6, every set
of cardinals is, with respect to the inherited order, isomorphic to a unique
ordinai.
As mentioned,'ĥnite ordinai','finite cardinaľ (and'natural number')
are synonymous. The situation is difĺerent in the infinite. Let us look at the

inßnite cardinals a little closer. First of all, denote the class of all such by
Cn cıo. The class of (infinite) cardinals is a proper subclass of that of (infinite)
ordinals. However, even though there seem to be'much more'ordinaıs 乞 han
cardinals, Cn oo is a proper clms, for it is unbounded within On and hence,
by Theorem 7. 5. 6, cannot be a set. In particular, ǆ orderings, (Cnoo, <)
and (On, <) are isomorphic. this isomorphism is of great importance. it
provides every infinite cardinal with a uniquely determined ordinai index,
and conversely ǆsigns to every ordinai a a unique infinite cardinal, which,
following Cantor, is denoted by No. 5 Thus every infinite cardinal is of the
form N. (and all these are different). Therefore infinite cardinals are also
called alephs.

For instance, being the first infinite cardinal, the ordinaJ u is equal to
the cardinal No. The smallest uncountable cardinal is N1. Then comes 82,
and so on. In general, given n < u, N. is the n + 1st inlinite cardinal. The
smallest aleph with an infinite index is N.. In general, given any ordinals a
and P, we have N. ś NB iff a < P. Fbrther, within (Cn-, <), the cardinal
No+1 is the successor of N.. Given a cardinal number n, not necessarily
in aleph notation, its successor (in (Cnoo, <)) is denoted by n+. Thus, if
-N.. Then +-Na+1 (while + = Tı + 1 in case n-n < u).

Since cmdinals behave quite differently from arbitrary ordinals, it is very
useful to have this separate notation. E. g., the successor of the ordinai (4) is
+ 1, i. e. The second countably infmite ordinai (which is not a cardinal, as
it hǆ the same power as its predecessor), while the successor of the cardinal
u, that is the successor of No. Is Nr (an ordinai much bigger than (4) + 1 or
even u + n for all n, for it is uncountable).

Another advantage of this indexing of infinite cardinals by ordinals is that
it allows us to apply the principles of transfinite itıduction and recursion not
only to Cn, but also to Cnoo (directly via the ordinai indices).

Since the successor of an infinite ordinai has the same cardinality, no
cardinal can be a successor ordinai. In other words, every cardinal is a
limit oTdimal. However, the reader might have already guessed that it is
reasonable to call a cardinal of the form n+ (where K is an arbitrary cardinal)
a successor cardinal. Correspondingly, a limit cardinal is defined to be
a cardinal of the form Nô, where ô is a limit ordinai. Thus No is the smallest
limit cardinal, and N. is the second biggest limit cardinal.

We defined the sum of ordinals in one of the exercises of the preceding
section. Also the other arithmetical operations can be defined in a canon-
ical way so that their arithmetic, restricted to natural numbers, coincides

with thc usual onc. In the infinite this arithmetic proves useful for the in-
vestigatian of welı-orderings (due to Theorem T. 5. 6). However, wc have to
refer t, he reader t, o olle of the set-theoretic texts for more details, and also
to Rosenstein's book cited in Appendix C, which contains some interesting
model theory of ordinai numbers.
The arithmetic of cardinal numbers is completely difïerent. While that
of ordinals is designed to reflect certain compositions of well-orderings, the
arithmetic of cardinals is designed to reflect cardinalities of compound sets
(and we will need the rudiments of it in the sequel to calculate certain
cardinalities). It is therefore natural to define the arithmetical operations
as follows.
Given 冯 入€ Cn, setn 十入 = def I 院 U 시, 代 · 人 = 己 ef I。X 시, and. 大 rdef I 入 · I.
As in the case of ordinai arithmetic, these operations coincide with the
usual ones (for natural numbers) on the set u. But we will see in due
course that in the infinite things are different. Nevertheless, many common
arithmetical rules hold true for arbitrary cardinals. For instance, using
appropriate bijections the reader may verify the ones listed below.
Remarks. Let , , /ı € Cn.

(1) (Cn 0; +) is a commutative monoid with neutral element 0 (cf. §5. 2).

(3) (Cn ; 1 ;-) is a corrimutative monoid with neutral element 1.

These are the bǆic laws of cardinal arithmetic which look (and are
verified) t. He same on Cn as on u). Next we turn to some propeľties that
are essentially different fr om those of natural numbers. h  · lost of them follow
more or less directly from the following.

Proof. By induction on € Cn oo
First we order the pairs of ordinale from I, tı(: eet y by the following
rule.
(a, ¢) (7, ô), provided
either max{a, ß} < max{T, ó},
or else max{a, ß} = max{T, lr } and or elsu a-7 and / 3 < ô.
Obviously, (× , ) is a (strict) linear ordering. In the caBe À-No-u
this ordering is the well-known ordering of u x u found by Cantor in or«ler
to prove the countability of Q, This also constitutes the initial etep of our
induction (the case No'No-No).
Let now À € Cn°o be arbitrary, and assume that K  · K-K for all K < À
(induction hypothesis). All we have to do in order to complete the induction
is derive 入  · À = 入 from this.
Let (7, ô) € 入 × 入 and E-maĵc{7, ô} + 1. Being an infirute cardinal, 入
is a limit ordinai. Hence E € 入 and (7, ô) (E, E) € 入 × 入. Moreover, the
entire section (入 × 入) (7, ô) given by (7, ó), is contained in € x E and therefore
hǆ a cardinality ś Ie x el = lel  · I € I. The latter is, by induction hypothesis,
equal to eı, hence smaller than 入.
Consequently, every section of × 入 has cardinality < . If we could
prove that (× 入, ) is a well-ordered set, hence isomorphic to some ordinaı
a (by Theorem 7. 5. 6), this would imply that a cannot be bigger than 入 (for
otherwise it would contain a section of power 入). In particular, we would
obtain 入 · 入 = 1 入 x 시 〈 1 시 = 入.
On the other hand, mark (5) above says that always À < 入  · 入. Thus,
indeed, it remains to verify that (入 × 入, ) is a well-ordered set.

First of all, the Zermelo-ħaenkel axioms imply that À × À is a set.
Let now O X c À × . Pick the least ordinai 17 in {max{a, P}
(a, ñ) € X} and then the leǆt ordinali in the set Y-def {a € On
there is ß with (a, ¢) € X and max{a, P} = ?7}. If now 6 is the least ordi-
nal such that (7, ô) € X, then obviously (7, ô) is the ıeast element in X, as
desired. D

Corollary 7. 6. 2. 玎 one ol the TıoTŁzero cardįTıaıs tt an 注 X is infinite, then

Proof Without loss of generality, let 入 be infinite and K < 入.

Clearly max{n, À} = 入 < + 入 ś 入 + 入. The la 忱 er sum is, by Remark
(14), not greater than  · , hence, by Hessenberg's theorem, not greater
than 入-max{n, 入 }. This shows K + 入-max{n, À}.

The inequality ltp (X) I > X is obvious for finite sets X (for 2"> n for

Proof We prove ltp (X) I > lxl. Consider singletons to see lţp (X) 1 > lxl. If
we had equality here, there would be a ħmction f from X onto P (X). Then
consider the set Y-def {  · € X : £ ¢ f (x) }. The surjectivity of f would
yield y € X with f (y) = Y. Then, for all × E X, we would have € f (y) iff
T ¢ f (z). But in the case T-y this is a contradiction. D
Remark. (About the cardinalities of number systems)

Clearly, INI = No. Hence, by Hessenberg's theorein, Ql = IN × Nl = No ·
No-No. Corollary 7. 6. 2 yields I%l = IN \ {0} U Nl = No + No-No. Lemma
7. 6. 4(2) implies that the continuum R has power IRI = INZI = N'_2No.
Invoking Hessenberg's theorem again, we then obtain C = IR × ml =
2No. 2No = 2No.

As a special case of Cantor's theorem we have 214o N1 or, equivalcntly, R > N1 ·
So the question arrises if this inequality is proper, i. e., if there is an uncountable
set having smaller cardinality than thc continuum. Cantor was convinced that this
was not the case. He tried to prove what tater became the continuum hypothesis
(and Hilbert,'s first problem)

Hence, the statements (CH) and (GCH) are, ǆ one says, independent of ZFC,
and the (deductive closure of) ZFC is thus an incomplete theory.
Finally we want ţo determine the cardinality of languages. The following
bound turns out to be of use in this.
We need some more set-theoretic notation. Given a set X and a cardinal
入, we use <ÀX to denote the union of the sets /ıx, where /ı runs over all
cardinals < 入. Since no confusion can arise, one often writes <wx instead of
<Nox. Fther, given a cardinal K, the cardinaliţy of the set < 入 K is denoted
by戺く入.
Of particular interest is the case 入 = No : the set <ux is the set of all
finite sequences of elements of (i. e. of a1ı ţuples from) X. Its cardinality,
for infinite X, can be computed ǆ follows.

proof Corollary 7. 6. 3 yields n nl = n"= n, hence, together with the preced-

Thus the set of all tuples from an inńniţe set hǆ the same power as that
set. This leads to the computation of the following important cardinaliţies.

Also the cardinal numbers were introduced by Cantor, albeit as abstract powers,
i. e. Equivalence classes of sets modulo the equivalence relation of having tho same
power (and also here he didn't care much about a set-theoretic justilication of their
existence). Again it was von Neumann who turned thein into concrete objects of
the set-thearetic universe, namely into ordinai numbers.
