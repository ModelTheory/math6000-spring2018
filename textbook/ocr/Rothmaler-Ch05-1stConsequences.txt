First consequences of the
finiteness theorem
As a first application of the finiteness theorem we derive a fundamental
result about arbitrarily large models. Then we give some simple applications
to classical structures. In order to apply the finiteness theorem to these,
we have to Erst axiomatize them in an appropriate (first-order) language.
Finally, we explain why the liniteness theorem is also called compactness
theorem. This leads to certain topological spaces, the so-called Stone spaces,
which we will return to later in Part IV. 1

Proof For any given set C of new constants, we are going to find a model
of E of power at least thc power of C.

For this, consider the following set of L (C)-sentences,

Ec_E u {c c'c, c'€ C and c ¢ c'}.

Since E has arbitraril large finite models or an infinite model, ev ery finite
subset E'€ Ec has a model, for in any sufficiently large structure we can
find pairwise distinct interpretations for thc finitcl,''many c occurring in E'.
The finiteness theorem yields a maciel of Ec,. Its L-reduct is then a model
of E of power > Cl. D

This was a t.' · pical, albeit easy application of the finiteness theorem. As
a consequence we see that finiteness is not axioinatizable. In particulnr, the
class of finite sets is not axiomatizablc (compare this w ith Exercise 4. 3. 4,

5. 2 Semigroups, nıonoids 1 and groups
In the next few sections we find axionıatizations of some well-known clasaea
of algebraic structures and see what immediate consequences of the {initeness
theorem nre can derive about them.

We choose appropriate languages, first for semigroups, monoids, and
groups, in wHch we are able to axiomatize these classes.

Consider the signature ( · ), where  · is a binary function symbol (whose
intended interpretation is the multiplication). In the corresponding ıanguage
we formulate the sentence

the axiom of associativity of the operation., Its models are precisely
what is known to be semigroups. We denote by SG the LH-theorr of all
semigroups, i. e. The deductive closure of om (1).

We simplify the expressions in this language by introducing the following
abbreviations.
Given a nomero m € N, the symbol z"stands for the term (..  · (z  · z)  ·
..  · )-Æ, where Æ occurs n times. We also write Æy instead of a  · y.

Let 1 be a constant symbol. If we add to (1) the (1 ;  · )-sentence
(2) V» (£1 = Æ A l£ = z),

saying that the interpretation of 1 is the neutral element of (the interpr»
tation of)., we obtain the system of axioms { (1), (2) } in the language L(1 ;  · ),
whose nıodels are called monoids. We denote by TM the L(1 ;  · )-theory of
all monoids, i. e. The deductive closure of { (1), (2) }.

In order to describe inverses we pass to a richer signature (1 ;.,-'), which
has in addition a unary function symbol-'(with the obvious intended inter-
pretation). Agaiïı we introduce some handy (and common) abbreviations.

We write £-"for the L(1 ;.,-')-term (Æ")-'(n as before), and zy-1 or
z/y for the term T  · (y-').

If we extend the previous aĵcioms by the L(1 ;.,-')-sentence

saying that (the interpretation of)'is the operation of taking inverses
with respect to (the interpretations of)  · and 1, we get { (1), (2), (3) }, which
axiomatizes the groups. That is, a group is an L(1 ;.,-')-structure satisfy-
ing this set of axioms. We denote by TG the L(1 ;.,-')-theory of aJ1 groups,
i. e. The deductive closure of { (1), (2), (3) }  ·

If we add also the conımutativity aJciom

for the oporation  · , we obtain the axionls of abelian grolrps. Usually one
writes abelian groups additively, that is, a structure for the signature

Let Lz denote the languıwe of this signature (O ; +,-) arid AG the Lz-
-1, a unary function symbol.
theory of all abelian groups, i. e. The deductive closure of the following
coı1ection of axioms.
(1) + Vxyz ((T + y) + z) = £ + (y + z))
(2) + V (£+O =£AO+r-T)
(3) + V£ (T + (-: c) = O A (-£) + £-O)
W j
The theory of torsionfree abelian groups, i. e., the Lz-theory with the
axioms AG U {v£ (nz-O--+ -O) : 1 < n € N}, is denoted by AGtr  ·
Similarly as in thc case of multiplication, we write ïz for the term
(... (T + £) +... ) + (rt times), where rı E N is not zero. Further, we
use (-Tı) £ to denote-(Tı), aiıd £-?j to denote £ + (-y).
Now that we have these axiomatizations, we can apply the finiteness the-
orem to derive interesting properties of axiomatizable classes of semigroups,
monoids, or groups. As an example we have the following result, and the
reader is asked to state and prove similar ones (see also the exercises).

k < Tı). Then E has a model containing am element ol infinite order
(i. e., an element a such that (1k ł 1 Jor all k € N).

proof Let L be a language cbntaining the langiıage of signature (1 ;  · ). Set
Lı_L (C) and r = E U {c"+ 1 : tı € N}, where C is a new constant. Any
model of V is a model of E, and the interpretation of c therein is the desired
element. Therefore it suĦices to ñnd a model of V. By the finiteness theorem
this is equivalent to finding a model for every fiïıite subset of E'. Now, every
such finite subset is contained in a set of the form E u {e k + 1 : k < Tı} for
some Tı € N, łıence it suffices to find a model for the latter. This is possible
by hypothesis, for given M = (M.. An), where M. E and am € M. has

A ring is said to be commutative if its multiplication is commutative,
i. e., if it satisiies axiom (4). The theory of all commutative rings is denoted
by CR. Note that CR is thus the deductive closure of TR U { (4) }  ·

54 CIJAPTER 5. FIRST CONSEQUENCES
axioïnatizes Łhc division rings. Wc denote the theory of all division rings
by DR. Commutative division rings, that is divisiotı ringe that are, as rings,
also commutative, are called fields, The theory of all fields is denoted by
TF. Thus TF is the deduclive « : losure of DR U { (4) }, whiclı i8 the barne as
the deductive closure of DR U CR.
Division rings arc also known ǆ skew fields, since they arc like ĥelds, except
they need not satisfy the commutativity ǆiom. We prcbr thc positive term diuision
ring, because skew could also suggest that the ring be noncommuŁative, which is
A, A
not mtenaeo.
For the above axiomatization we chose not to include the operation of
taking multiplicative inverses into the signature. The reason is that it would
not be total, as 0-1 is not defined, while, in our setting, all function symbols
have to be interpreted by total functions. One remedy would be to assign
to 0-1 an arbitrary, but fixed (and irrelevant) value, like e. g. O. We chose
not to do so (which seems to be closer to the usual mathematical practice)
and to use z-1 as an abbreviation instead. More precisely, given a division
ring }C, as an L(0, 1 ; +,-,  · )-structure, and an element O # a € K, we use
a-'to denote the uniquely deterlnined b satislying a  · b = 14 b  · a-1.
Note that due to this choice of signature every substructure of a division
ring is a subring (that need not be a division ring). 3 The same applies to
fields, of course, which means that a substructure of a field need not be a
field. We therefore introduce the term subfield to mean a subring which i8
a lield in its own right. (Note that the inverses of nonzero elements are the
same, whether taken in a subñeld or the initial ńeld.)
An important invariant of a division ring is its characteristic, as defined
next. The characteristic of a division ring /c is the sïnallest nat ural number
p such that /c p1 = 0, if such a number exists, and 0 otherwise. Hence /c
has characteristic O if and only if K {pl 0 : p > O}.

Thus the characteristic of /c DR is simply the order (in the sense of
proposition 5. 2. 1) of the element 1 in the additiue group of /c, i. e., in the
(O ; +,-)-reduct of /c. Recall that this number, if not O, is always a prime
(see Exercise 5. 3. 3 below).

The clms of division rings of fixed characteristic is also axiomatizable.
It. Is obvious that in the case of positive characteristic we need to add to
DR only finitely many-in fact just one--extra axiom for this purpose. We
will see shortly, as an emy application of the ñniteness theorem, that in the
characteristic zero cǆe tĮıis is impossible.

aThe abstinence we impose on the signature will pay oft ıater in the quantilier elimi-
nation for algebraically closed fields, cf. §9. 4

Let q be a prime uumber or 0. Then Dlłq denotes the theory of all
division rings of characteristic q similarly for TFq ·

Recall from basic algebra that every field of characteristic 0 contains a
subfield isomorphic to Q, the field of rational numbers. 4 Similarly, every
lield of characteristic pl with p a prime number, contains a subfield iso-
morphic to Fpt where ]Fp denotes the field with universe Zp, that is the
(0, 1 ; +,-,  · )-expansion of Zp by multiplication modulo p (more precisely,
the expansion obtained by interpreting  · as multiplication modulo p). These
sublields are known as the prime fıelds. Tb summarize, the prime field of a
field F i8 isomorphic to Q or Øp, depending on whether F has characteristic
0 or p (> O).

Note that Z p is the (0 +,-)-reduct, in more common terms, the additive
group of Fp  ·

In analogy to the proposition about orders in (expansions of) groups
in the previous section, the !initeness theorem yields the following about
characteristics of (expansions of) division ringa. By the characteristic of
an expansion of a division ring we here simply mean the characteristic of
the underlying division ring.

Proof We have to show that Eı = E U {pl + 0 p > 0} is consistent, for
which, by the finiteness theorem, it suññces to show that every finite subset
i8 coıHistent. Every such subset, Eı, is contained in some set of the form
E U {n1 0 : n < p}, where p i8 a prime. But the latter set has, by
hypothesis, a model (mmely one of characteristic p). D
Remark. Note that the set E may contain sentences of the possibly larger
language L. However, important only is that it has, for every natural number
n, a model whose (0, 1 ; +,-,  · )-reduct is a division ring of characteristic n.

to a sum of monomials, where in addition occtlrrences of the same variable

we obtain are polynomials with coefficients from %. The above term, for
instance, is CR-equivalent, to 2ry + 2×2z + ?ïıry 2z-7ïıÆ3/3, which is a poly-

Vector spaces over a Jized division ring K are usually regarded as structures
of the signature (O ; +,-) U {fk k € K}, where the Tk are unary func-
tion symbols (for the multiplication by the scalars k € K). We denote the
corresponding language by Ltc  ·

Consider the following sets of LK-sentences.
(2) {Vzy (Tk(z + y) = Tk (Æ) + Tk (y)) : k € K}
(3) {Vz (Tk+k·(z) = fk (Æ) +fk'( · )) : k, k'€ K}

Together with AG these axiomatize the class of left vector spaces over
JC (or left /c-vector spaces). We denote the Ltc-theory of all such spaces
by TK. Thus nc is the deductive closure of AG and the above four sets.
Recall that every vector space has a uniquely determined dimension and
that two vector spaces over the same divisiotı ring are isomorphic if and only
if they have the same dimension (if the reader knows this only for vector
spaces over fields, he or she may want to go over the proofs again and check
that they never use the commutativity of the lield).

5. 4 Vector spaces
Vector spaces over a Jized division ring /c are usually regarded as structures
of the signature (O ; +,-) u {Tk : k E K}, where the fk are unary func-
tion symbols (for the multiplication by the scalars k € /c). We denote the
corresponding language by LK ·

Consider the following sets of Ltc-sentences.
(2) {Vzy (fk(z+y) = fk (£) +Tk(uD : kE K}
(3) {Vz (Tk+k  · () = fk (£) 十 fk'()) : k, k'€ K}

Together with AG these axiomatize the class of left vector spaces over
K (or left /c-vector spaces). We denote the L]c-theory of all such spaces
by T)c. Thus T)c is the deductive closure of AG and the above four sets.

Recall that every vector space has a uniquely determined dimension and
that two vector spaces over the same division ring are isonıorphic if and only
if they have the same dimension (if the reader knows this only for vector
spaces over fields, he or she mw want to go over the proofs again and check
that they never use the commutativity of the field).

sponding names of orderings).
(1) Vx-x<x

Remark. Because of the irreflexivity, (1), homomorphisms of linear order-

Consider the following endpoint ǆioms, whose names are to suggest the
stated existence or lack of left or right endpoints.
We use T« to denote the L<-theory of all partial orderings, LO to denote
that of all linear orderings, and DLO to denote that of all (nontrivial) dense
linear orderings. Thus these theories are the deductive closures of the cor-
responding sets of axioms used to deline the respective classes of orderings
above. We denote the deductive closure of DLO U { (-+) } by DLO_ll and
call this the theory of dense linear orderings with a right, but no left
endpoint ; similarly for the other three endpoint axioms.

We simplify notation by introducing sonıe common abbreviations : z >
y >def y<Æ and <y def <yv= y and also y def

% < y.

We will consider orderings in more detail in Chapter 7.

Often one can order structures in such a way that the operations of the
signature are in sonıe sense compatible with the order. A few cases are
collected next.

A partially ordered group is a (1 ; · ; <)-structure satisfying

Vzyuu (z < y 1ıTu < hytt)
whose (1 ;  · )-reduct is a group and whose (<)-reduct is a partial ordering.
This partial ordering is also called a partial ordering of the underlying
group. If this ordering is linear, we speak of a linear ordering and corr»
spondingly of a linearly ordered group.

A partially ordered ring is a (0, 1 ; +,-,'; <)-structure satisfying

Every boolean algebra can be partially ordered by stipulating that z < y
if and only if z+y-!. And Æ < y if and only x < y and E + y. Obviously, in
this ordering 1 is the greatest element and 0 is the smallest eıement. Ǆrther,
it is not hard to see that, with respect to this partial ordering, Æ + y is the
smallest upper bound (the supremztm) while T  · 3/is the greatest lower bound
(the inRmum) of the set {x, y} for any £, y.

X that contains O and X and i8 closed under takins (fini) uniom and
intersections a8 well a8 conıplemente.. Then (S O, X u, n, X\) i8 called a
booıean alsebra of set8 or just a set al8ebra. It i8 easy m Bee that
this i8 in«leed a boolean algebra. In euch an algebra the ordering delined
above turns out to be set inclusion, It i8 an important result of the theory
of boolean algebras that, conversely, every boolean algebra i8 isomorphic
to ('can be represented aB') a set algebra. More precisely, one can embed
every boolean algebra 13 in the boolean algebra of au subsets of a certain
set. (Hence, when looking for a boolean algebra with certain properties,
one may as well confine oneself to set algebras.) We will sta this famous
result without proof (a8 Theorem 5. 6. 1). However, the right choice of this
set, wHch is the so-called Stone space of B, is half way down the road
to a complete proof. In order to define this properly we have to extend
the concept of filter and ultralilter (from 4. 1 and 4. 2) to arbitrary boolean
aıgebras, which we do next.
Let LI BA. A nonempty subset F Ç B is called a filter of the booleaiı
algebra ı3 if the following conditions are satisfied for all a, b € B.
(i) O¢F

If a, b € F, then a  · b € F.

(iii) If a € F and a<b, thenb € F.

Note that all we did in this generalization is replace (the algebra of
subsets of) the set I and the partial order of inclusion by alı arbitrary
boot algebra 13 and its canonical partial orderingı respectively. Irı the
same way we can generalize principal filter, generation, ultraltlter, and
principal ultrafilter. E. g., given an element b ¢ 0 in B, the principal
filter generated by b i8 the set F (b) = {a € B : b ś a} ; and an ultrafilter
of B is a filter, F, such that a € F or ıi € F for every a € B. It is conımon
to use S (jB) to denote the set of all ultrafilters of ı3, where 'S'stands for
(M. H.) Stone.
Remarks. Ľet B BA.

(1) 1 € F for every filter F of ı3.

(2) Given F C B satisfying filter axiom (iii), F satisfies axiom (i) if and

only if F¢B.

(3) The sets <a> =def {Æ € S (B) : a € =}, where a runs through B,

form a basis of a topology on S (B), the so-called Stone topology.
The corresponding space is known as the Stone space of the boolean
algebra B and denoted by S (13) again.

As in the previous clıapter, Zorn's lemma can be used to show that
every ĺilter of a boolean algebra can be extended to an ultrafilter. In
general some form of the axiom of choice is necessary for this. If the
boolean algebra happens to be well-ordered, however, in particular, if
it is countable, there is a way around this (exercise!).

A subset of a topological space is said to be clopen if it is at the same
time closed and open. A Stone space is a nonempty topological space
wHch has a basis of clopen sets and which is compact (in the sense that
every covering by open subsets contains a finite subcovering) and hausdorlf
(in the sense that any two distinct points can be separated by disjoint open
subsets)  ·

An atom in a boolean algebra is an element z + O such that there's no
element between O and , i. e., for all y with 0 < y < we have either y-O
or y-Æ. A boolean algebra is called atomic if for every £ # 0 there is an
atom y with y < z. A boolean algebra is said to be atomless if it contains
no atoms.

Remark. There are boolean algebras that are neither atomic nor atomless
(exercise!).
We obtain aĵciomatizations for the class of atomic boolean algebras by
adding the axiom

passing to representatives ; exercise!).

Then ı3L-(Lo/-; 上/., T/-; V, A,-) forms a boolean algebra, the
Lindenbaum-Tarski algebra of the language L.

One can extend tMs as follows to T-equivalence modulo an arbitrary
Ltheory T as well as to arbitrary formulas.

Suppose T is an theory (or evenjust a subset of Lo) and Ē is an Tı-tuple
of variables.

Given y?, € LE, we wTite p śT if T VĒ({p ), and we write
V-T if V śT and śT 1o. Then (LĒ/-T ; 1/-Tt T/-T ; V, A,-)
forms a boolean algebra whose isomorphism type depends on n and T only,
whence the notation 13. (T) for it. Its canonical ordering, again denoted by
śT, satislies p /-T śT/-T iĘ T Viŕ (V ). The algebra B. (T) i8

ultralilters are the complete btheories (exercise!).

5. 7 Some topology (or why the finiteness theorem
is also called compactness theoremu)
Tbis section serves among other things as preparation for §9. 1 (in particular
Lemma 9. 1. 1) and §11. 3. Another objective is to show that the finiteness
theorem is equivalent to the compactness theorem saying that the set of all
complete L-theories, equipped with a certain topology, is compact (in the
sense of the previous section). The proof of the direction that finiteness
follows from compactness is left ǆ an exercise. However, we are going to set
the stage for this. Note that we may not use the liniteness theorem then!
Consider the set of all complete L-theories, and denote it by SL. Given
V E Lo, set <V> =def {T € SL V € T}. As qA is in T if and only if V and
Q are in T, we see that <v>n(V  · > = <VA>. Hence {<v> : v € Lo} constitutes
a basis for a topology on Sİ,. Denote the resulting topological space again
by SL. This reminds us of Remark (3) before Th e"T 5. 6. 1 and might
deceive us into inferring that this is the Stone space of the Lindenbaum-
Tarski algebra 召し  · As a matter of fact, it is (Exercise 5. 6. 6)! What's wTong
then? The point is that this rests on the finiteness ţheorem, which we
must not use, at least not in the proof that compactness implies finiteness.
We could use the Stone space argument, of course, in the proof of the other
direction (that ĥniteness implies compactness), which would then be a trivial
consequence of the Stone representation ţheorem. However, we want to
avoid this latter theorem and give a straightforward proof instead, which is
interesting in its own right, see Theorem 5. 7. 1 below. Finally, this is a good
exercise in understanding Stone spaces.
So let's get back to the topological space Sı. As defined above. Its basic
open sets <v> are also closed, for SL \ <q) = <-v>. Hence Sİ. Has a bǆis of
clopen sets. It is also hausdorft, since for all T, T'€ SL with T ¢ T'there
is p € Lo such that T € M and T'E <-v>. (That SL is a Stone space will
follow-without the use of stone's theorem-once we have compactness)  ·

Hence the closed sets of Sl, are the sets of the form nv € E <P> = {T € SL

in every infinite ardinality up to isomorphism exactly one model. That
