Malcev's applications to
group theory

In this chapter we present a method for the transfer of certain properties of
finiţely generated subgroups of a given group to the group itself developed
by Anatolij Ivanovich Malcev [read :'Maltsev'] in his clǆsical paper

[A. I. Malcev : A general method for obtaining local theorems in group theory]

only in the 1971 volume of his collected papers (pp. 15-21) cited in Ap
pendix H.

We start with an account of the method of diagrams, introduced indæ
pendently by Malcev and Abraham Robinson, and proceed with the method
of interpretation, which seems to have been some sort of folklore as early as
in the thirties.

6. 1 Diagrams
Recall that if a structure M is a substructure of a structure N, then all
symbols of the signature are interpreted in M in the same way as they are
(on the subset M) in N in other words, M P(ã) if and only ifN P(ã)
for every unnested atomic formula D and every tuple ã from M. In the first
lemma we extend this to arbitrary quantffier-free formulas 0 ·

unnested atomic formulas for that).

For thc converse, we need only show that condition ť) for unnested
fornmlas-as given by the definition of substructure-implies the full con-
dition ť). Thc first step for this is to prove ť) for all atomic formulas,
which can be easily established by an induction on the complexity of terms
occurring in the atomic formulas. The second stepi an induction on the
complexity of the quantilier-free formulas, is even easier, since the condition
(*) easily'extends'to conj unctions, disjunctions and negations. The details
are left as an exercise. D

Next we introduce some useful technical notation. Suppose M and N
are structures and is an arbitrary class of formulǱ (not necessarily from
L).
We write M şa JV or JV Ęa M if M çp implies N ço, for all
q € A n Lo (or, equivalently, ThaM C ThaN). The notation M 三 Ą JV
is used to denote that both, M a N and JV A M hold. We omit the
subscript A in case A J Lo ·

Ą
'1'ne notation ì : M N means, by dehmtron, that J : M IV and

that M qp (iı) implies JV 0 (f[ã]), for all q € A n L (hence also for
L-formulas Ęp containing free variables) and all matching tuples ã from M.
For reasons of tradition we write f : M JV instead of f : M į JV. If
Ą-{v}, we omit the braces..

For technical reasons we have built some redundancy into these defini-
tions : in M a JV (or f : M JV) only those formulas in A count that
are also in L. For instance, if A contains all of L, then f : M N says
nothing more than just f : M_)V.

As an illustration, we state a few facts whose proof we leave as an exer-

are known as elementary maps and will be investigated in more detail in
§8. 2.

Let M be an structure. The diagram of M, in symbols D (M), is,
by definition, the set of all atomic and negated atomic L (M)-sentences that
are true in M i. e.

D (M) = {q (ã) : M (p (ã), q € L is atomic, iį in M} u

{-p (iį) : M -q (iį), 1o € L is atomic, ii in M}.

The diagram of M is thus the set of all L (M)-literals that are sentences
and true in M. The diagram of an empty structure is empty, as empty struc-
tures exist only in languages without constant symbols, which, by Remark
(3) in §2. 5 have no atomic sentences.
Example. The diagram of a group is TG-equivalen6 to the Cayley diagram
(i. e. Its multiplication table) joined by all negations of term equations that
are not true in the group (see also the remark at the end of §6. 4 *).
Lemma 6. 1. 1 can now berestated like this : M C JV if and only if M C JV,
M is closed under functions, and (N, M) D (M). The latter is equivalent

Proof. Ad (1). Let A be the set of all litera]s. As in the preceding lemma, we
have f : M H N iff 1 : M E JV iff f : M JV. But the latter is obviously
equivalent to UV, f[Ar]) F D (M).

Let p be of the forni 3x V  · (z, ti), where li  · € L, t+1 and ii € M". Suppose
that for all b € AI we have M F v1(b, ii) iff JV F V  · (1 (b), J[ii]). We have to

Note that M F J£ v"J(z, li) if and only if M F a(b, ii) for some b € M.
By the above supposition the latter is, in turn, equivalent to the existence
of some b E Af such that N F '(f (b), f[] ). Since f is surjective, this is
equivalent to the existence of c € JV such that N F qJ(c, f[ii]), hence to

which, to ₩ ther with the latter, implies M T by Proposition 6. 1. 3).

Lemma 6. 2. 1 implies that V-theories are preserved in substructures. We
are going to prove t, he converse, for which we need the next lemma. Before
that consider the following application of the previous lemma.

(ii) 4 (i). Let Ty C T'and M T'. We have to find some N T
with M JV. By Lemma 6. 1. 2 (2) this is equivalent to the consistency of
T u D (M).

Assume T U D (M) is inconsistent. Then there is a finite conjunction,
(p (ii), of formulas from D (M) such that T U {qo (ä) } is inconsistent, hence
T -q (ĉį). Since the constants iį do not occur in T, the lemma on new
constants (3. 3. 2) then implies T VĒ-0 (), hence VĒ-q (Ē) € T. But
VĒ-v () € V (as V € qf), whence VĒ-v () € Tv. Then M T'and
Ty C T'imply M VĒ-v (), which contradicts the fact that q (ĉi) holds

Remark. The case T'-Tv shows that

i. e., the models of the V-part, Ty, of a theory T are fup to isomorphism)
precisely the substructures of models of T. (In Lemma 8. 3. 1 we will see that
we may omit the clause ° up to isomorphism'.) FOm this one can derive that

Proof In view of Exercise 3. 3. 4 it suūces to show that (ii) holds if and
only if Đ (ĉ) is T-equivalent to a seţ of V-sentences in L (č) (where č are new
constants). If M'and JV'are L (č)-structures with M · Ç W, then, for
their reducts M and N, we have M ç N, and there is ii € M"such
that M'_(M, ii) and W = (N, ii). Conversely, if iı E M"and M C )V,
then (M, ii) Ç (N, ã) as L (č)-structures. Hence (ii) is equivalent to the
fact that the set of L (č)-sentences, Đ (č), is preserved in substructures whose
breducts are thenaselves nıodels of T.
If now Q (č) is T-equivaleǄ to a set of V-sentences, then (ii) follows from
Lemma 6. 2. 1 for L (č).

For the converse, let Ø (č) be preserved in substructures whose Lreducts
are themselves models of T. Let g (Ĉ) be the V-part of (TuĐ (Č)) (in L (Č))  ·
By the above remark, the models of U (ĉ) are precisely the L (č)-substructures
of models of T u ĝ (ĉ). Hence, under the above preservation hypothesis, the
models of T U V (č) are also models of T U Đ (ĉ). Consequently T U Đ (ĉ) and
T u W (ĉ) are equivalent, i. e., Đ (ĉ) and (č) are T-equivalent. D

Pr ool. The second clause is, by the the preceding proposition, equivalent to
the above (i) for ĝ-{P}. Invoking the finiteness theorem this shows that
q is T-equivalent to (the conjunction of) Jinitely many V-formulas. But a
conjunction of V-formulas is equivalent to an V-formula. So (i) says, in this
case, that q is T-equivalent to a single V-formula, as desired. D

Proof. Apply proposition 6. 2. 3, where ¢) is thc theory under consideration
and T-0 (and ?ı-O). D
Ļet us turn to the inverse situation of pǆsing from substructures to
bigger structures. Suppose T is an L-theory. Mod T (or just T) is said to
be closed under (or preserved in) extensions if M T implies N T,
for all nonempty L-structures M and N with M N.
Remark. As in the previous case, this preservation also holds true for gen-
er al embeddings : if T is preserved in extensions, then it is aıso preserved in
embeddings (upward), i. e., if M Aí and M T then JV T (by the
same argument ǆ in the corresponding remark after Lemma 6. 2. 1),

The contraposiţive of Lemma 6. 2. 1 shows that if f : M N then also
f : M Aí, for the 3-formulas are precisely (equivalent to) the negations
of the V-formulas. In particular, M implies M a N, hence 3-
sentences are preserved under taking extensions. Again there is a corre-
sponding preservation theorem, i. e., the converse is true too, ǆ we will
show in the remainder of this section.
If we restrict ourselves to single sentences (or finitely axiomatizable the-
ories), this is almost immediate. First of all, it is easy to see that Corollary
6. 2. 4 implies the following dual (exercise!).

Corollary 6. 2. 6. LeŁ T be an L-theory.
An L-lom1ıla lĒ) is T-equivalent to an 3-ĵomula į$ anď only įĵ, îoT
all M T and Aí T 1uith M C JV, we haųe M į Aí (t. e. M v (ii)

As a special ease, we have

presemed in extensįons įl arŁd only įĵ V is equįuaįent to an 3-state1TŁent (re-
spectiuely, T ts an 3-theory). D
The reason that the direction cannot be derived so easily for arbi-
trary (non-finitely axiomatizable) theories T is that in general M T is
not the same as M {-q : q € T} (in other words, it is impossible in
general to take the negation of an infinite set of sentences). Nevertheless,
the theorem can be proved, albeit by a more complicated argument.

Remark. The assertion states that T is a A-theory if and only if T Ç T
for all completions T'of T. Thus the lemma holds for complete theories per

Pr ool. The direction 4 is trivial. For the nontrivial direction, let JV T& ·
We have to verify JV T (cf. Remark (2) in ₩. 4). By hypothesis, for this
we only have to find M T such that JV THAM.

So let ôi € A E < n) and N Ai<.-ôi. Denote the sentence Vi«. ôi by
p. Then N -(p and, by hypothesis, p is in A. If T U {-ôi : i < n} were
inconsistent, we would have T V : hence q € Ta and thus also N fp, °
contradiction.
Consequently there is a model M T u Th. ĄN, which, by Renıark (8)
at the end of §6. 1, may be chosen disjoint from N. D

Noting that this lemma applies to the case A-3, we are now able to
give a proof of the preservation theorem for extensions.
Theorem 6. 2. 9. (Łoś'Preservation Theorem) A theory is pïcsemed in ea-
tensions if arıď only i$ it is an 3-theory.
Pr ool. We proved already that 3-theories are preserved in extensions. For
the converse, suppose the theory T is preserved in extensions. Let us first
prove the following ǆsertion.

ť) THJVUD (M) is consistent for every structure M and all nıodels N

JV Ĵ v (Ē). Hence there is a tuple b in N such that N (p (b). Then
(N, b) ThJVu {0 (ã) }, and ť) follows on applying the finiteness theorem.

In order to prove that T is an 3-theory, by the preceding lemma, we
need only show that N T, whenever M T and N ThĵM. Suppose
M and N are of that kind. Condition ť) yields a model of ThN U D (M),

6. 3 Finitely generated structures and local prop-

erties

We are going to investigate properties of structures that are determined by
their finitely generated subst, ructures.

Remark. The intersection of an arbil, rary collection of substructures of a
given structure is again a substructure of that structure (possibly empty)  ·
More precisely, the intersection of the universes is closed under functions
fi · om the signature and is therefore the universe of a uniquely determined
substruct ure.
This allows us to make the following definition. Suppose M is an L-
struct, ure and X C M. The substructure generated by X in M is,
by (iefinition, the uniquely determined substructure w ith universe n(N
. T C, Lr, N C JW}, which we denote by JV. v-(Thus M. Y is the smallest,

6. 3. FINTTELY GENERATED STRUCTURES 77
substrucLuL
Mx = M.

A substructure of M is said to be flnitely generated if it is generated by
a finite set, i. e., if it is of the form Mx for some ńnite X Ç M. A structure
is called finiteıy generated if it is a finitely generated substrucţure of itself.

Let p be an ǆbitrary property of structures. We say that M has
locally p if every finitely generated substructure of M has the property p ·

We often identify a property of structures with the class of structures
it defines. So a property p is said to be elementary (or axiomatizable)
if the class of all L-structures with this property is eıementary, i. e. Axiom-
atizable. Similarly, a property is said to be hereditary if it is preserved
in substrucţures. We often identify an axiomatizable property with the set
of axioms it is axiomatized by. (One could avoid the usage of the term
° property'altogether, but it may serve as a shorter way of saying things
sometimes.)

Exercise 6. 3. 1. Show that the substructure of an structure generated by the
erapty set is empty if and only if L has no constant symbols.

Exercise 6. 3. 2. Let M be an L-structure and X Ē M. Verify that the universe,

satisfres (M, X) =at (N, f[×]) (and is thus injective). Extend f to an isomorphism
F : Mx JVf [x] and prove (M, Mx) 三 at (N, F[M×]).

Examples of local properties are locally finite, locally embeddable
in a structure N (i. e., every finitely generated substructure is embeddable
in JV), locally embeddable in a structure of a given class K (i. e., ev-
ery ñnitely generated substructure is embeddable in some structure lrom
K). For the latter we simply say locally embeddable in the class K. A
group-theoretic example is locally cycliclocally!cyclic (i. e., every ĥnitely
generated subgroup is cyclic).

Next we consider a few examples showing that a structure having a
property p locally need not itself have p ·

Examples.

(1) The easiest one is an infinite set M with no further structure, i. e. a

model of T°o. Since the substructure generated by a subset is just this
subset itself, M is locally finite (buţ not linite).

(2) The same applies to just any purely relacional structure, i. e. a structure

M whose signature has no constant or function symbols. Also then the
substrucţure generated by a subset X C M is simply the restriction of
M ţo that set X. Hence M is locally finite (but not necessarily finite).

Then N is locally embeddable, but not embcddable in M, for M hǆ
no infinite chains. (However, N is embeddable in Mod Th M, as the

PToof For the nontrivial direction, choose an axiomatization T of K (i. e.,
K-MoDLT) and consider TUD (M). If N'TUD (M), then the L-
reduct N of N'is a model of T, hence N € K. Further, N D (M) implies
M N, by the diagram lemma.

Thus, all we have to do is show that TuD (M) is consistent. By the
finiteness theorem it suffices that every finite subset of TuD (M) have a
model. Every suclı finite subset is easily seen to be contained in a set of the
form TUD (Mo) for all appropriate choice of a finitely generated substructure
Mo C M. By hypothesis, however, there is an embedding f of Mo in some
No E K. Hence T u D (Mo) has a model, namely (AO, f[MO] ). D

Here we have a case where a local property implies the corresponding
° global'property-one also says that the local theorem holds for this prop-
erty. We will see much deeper ones in due course.

The proof of Henkin's c r iterip can be modified to yield the local theorem
for every property that is both(hereditary and elementary (I. e. preserved
under substructures and axiomatizable). We conclude this section with a
proof of this. Some remarks are in order before that.
Remarks. (1) Since elementary properties are invariant under isomor-

phism (cf. Proposition 6. 1. 3), every hereditary and elementary prop-
erty passes from any structure M down to all structures embeddable in
M, cf. The situation in the remark aft. Er Lemma 6. 2. 1.
(2) By the Lo§-Tarski preservation theorem (Corollary 6. 2. 5), the heredi-

tary and elementary properties are exactly those which are expressible
by sets of V-sentences, I. e. By V-theories.

Examples. Consider
group theory.

(5) The property of being abelian is hereditary and elementary (take E-

{v£y (xy-yx) })  ·
(6) The property of being of exponent k (I. e., satisfying V (k_1), is

hereditary and elementary.
(7) The property of being periodic (I. e., every element has finite order)

clearly is hereditary, but not elementary (see Corollary 5. 2. 2).

(8) The property of being locally finite clearly is hereditary, but not ele-

(9) The property of being divisible is elementary, but not hereditary.

6. 4 The interpretation lemma
The general technique of interpretation'is a tool to code structures in other
structures-possibly (and often desirably) of different signature. We con-
line ourselves to the particular case of interpretation of factor structures of
substructures in a given structure, since this suffices for the group-theoretic
applications we are after. In particular, our interpretations here do not
change signatures-a restriction one would not want to make in a general
treatment of int, erpretation. (See also the first two exercises below for an-
other direction of generalizaţion.)

In order to code factor structures of substructures in L-structures we
expand the language L by a predicate (i. e. a unary relation symbol), P,
for the substructure and a binary relation symbol, E, for the factorization.
The resulting language is denoted by L'. (Abusing the notation slightly,
one often writes L + = L U {P, E} to express this.)

Consider EpE, the union of the following (sets of) L'-sentences.

L\) VTZ IPLĽ) A PL) A P(, 1 = Elx, xl A IE(T yl H EI, x)1 A tELE, y) A

E(u, z)-E(£, z))) ('E is an equivalence relation on P'),

in a structure, as introduced in Chapter 3.

If M EpE, then, in the following canonical way, P (M)/E can be
regarded as an L-structure.

First some notation. Given a € P (M), set a/E = {.'€ P (M)
E(a, a ı) }. If A Ç P (M), let A/E denote {a/E a € A} ; and for a tuple
ii = (ao,..  · ıan-1) from P (M) use ä/E to denote (ao/E,... Tan-1/E).

Then M'-def P (M)/E becomes an L-structure by the following stipu-
lations. Given c € C, set cM'_c"/E given f € F and a matching tuple ii
Om P(M), set fm'(ã/E) = fm(ã)/E and, given R € R and a matching
tuple ii kom P (M), let M'R (tilE) if and only if M R (ii). Since E
is a strict congruence relation (in the above sense), this definition does not
depend on the choice of representatives.

We call M'the canonical factor structure of P (M) modulo E and
say that the structure M'(and every structure isomorphic to it) is inter-
preted in M.

Example. Let L be the language of signature (1 ;.,-').

Then (2) above is TG-equivalent to

and also to

P(1) Ą VToÆ1 (P(zo) A P(T1) P(zoz'll.

Thus (2) says that P (M) is closed under multiplication and inverses, i. e.
that P (M) is a subgroup. (3) is TG-equivalent to
VZ01UOy1 ((p (oo) A p (o1) A p (vo) A p (3/1) A E(zo, uo) A E(1, w)) 4

Along with (1) and (2), this implies

hence that 1/E-{a € P (M) : E(a, 1) } is a normal subgroup of P (M). M

6. 5 * Malcev's local theorems
Throughout this section, L denotes the language of signature (1 ;.,-').

Using the interpretation lemma, in an appropriate expansion of a group
we ūrst elementarily express the property of being of type (21,..., E.). We
have seen that in a group g the formula P'(T) >def P (£) AE(£, 1) defines
the normal subgroup 1/E of P (g) and that P (g)/E is isomorphic to the
factor group P (g)/P'(g). If, conversely, a formula P'(Æ) defines a normal
subgroup P'(Éï) of P (g) in É, then setting E(T, y) def P'(zy-') we
obtain a congruence relation such that P (€i)/P'(g) P ()/E.

Consider an expansion of the language L by two new predicates P and
p'. Let Epp, be the set obtained from EpE by replacing each subformula of
the form E(1ı, u) by P'(11o-'). Then, given a group g and a corresponding
expansion g', we have g'Epp, iff P'(g) P (g).

Again we can do this Tı-foldly. Given new predicates Po,..., Pin, let L'_
Lu {Po,..., P. } and r = Ui<. EPP+1 U {vz Po () A v£ (P.(z)-> z-1) }  ·

Lemma 6. 5. ı. 5lippose Er,..., E. are elementary properties. For alį i <
n, consider the set (2i+1) : = {vĮ : 1o €卫 i+1} (įuhere the : are the maps

mentioned completes the proof then, L]

There are numerous applications of this result, of which we consider
only a few here (and in the exercises to §7. 2'). Other applications can be
found in the cited literature, especially in §§22 and 26 of the group theory
text by Kargapolov and A  · lerzljakov (Lwo younger colleagues of Malcev at
Novosibirsk), where a stronger version of Malcev '5 local theoFem-for more
generallogics-can be found. See also Corollary 6. 6. 8 in Hodges'Model
Theory, where a proof of the local theorem for the property of having a
faithful n-dimensional linear representation is given. Following Hodges, this
latter 1940 result of Malcev was the first application of the finiteness theorem
in algebra!

has an abelian normal subgroup A of index < n (I. e. such that lg/Al < Tz)'

If now g is abelian-by-finite, it has a normal subgroup A q of a certain
finite index n-lg/Al. Then g is of type (E.. E). Now this direction, as
well as its converse, follow from Malcev's local theorem. D

Example. Consider a periodic group I of m x m-matrices over thc field
C of complex numbers. Schur's so-called second theorem asserts that q is
abelian-by-finite. This can be derived, using the preceding corollary, from
Schur's so-called first theorem saying that is locally finite and a theorem
of Jordan saying that finite groups of m x m-matrices over U have an abelian
normal subgroup whose index depends only on m.
A group is said to be solvable of degree < TL if it has a normal series of length
< n with abelian factors. There is an easy proof of the local theorem for this
property using a different definition (via some well-known commutator conditions).
However, to practice this section's material, we include

Exercise 6. 5. 1. Derive the local theorem for solvability of degree at most n from
Malcev's theorem.
