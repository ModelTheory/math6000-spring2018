Semantics
Now that we have structures and corresponding formal expressions, the cru-
cial step is to establish a connection between the two. More precisely, we
want to assign a meaning to each expression in any given structure of cor-
responding signature. Technically speaking, in every such structure we will-
interpret the expressions of our language in such a way that terms become
elements of the structure and sentences of the language turn into statements
about these elements so that we can assign a truth value to each sentence
(depending only on the structure under consideration). This is straightfor-
ward if no quantifiers occur (and will constitute the initial step in our formaJ
definition). WHen quantiliers do occur, however, we run into problems : we
are forced to interpret also formulas containing free variables. Alfred Tarski
found the right way to do this, which we will study in the first section.

[Tarski, A. : Der WahrheitsbegrifF in den formalisierten Sprachen, Studia Philosoph.
1 (1935) 261-405]

The extra work involving formulas with free variables pays off, as we will
see in the second section. Namely, not only are we able to assign a truth

wlue to sentences (formulas tuithotıt free variables) in each structure, but %Đ
we will see that to any formula tuith free variables, in every structure, we
can naturally assign a'solution set'of elements (or tuples, depending on the
number of free variables) of that structure. It is this 'functorial'ǆpect of

formulas that carries model theory beyond mere (logical) axiomatizability

questions.

We will interpret the expressions of the language inductively according
to their syntactic complexity. The initial step is built into the notion of
structure, since a structure comes equipped with the interpretation of the
symbols of the signature. This provides a natural interpretation of unnested

ternıs and unnested atomic formulas in that structure. All this requires a
little care and preparation, which we now begin.
3. 1 Expansions by constants, truth and satisfac-
tion
As, in general, quantification binds free variables, in the process of build-
ing a formula from atomic subformulǆ the number of free variables often
drops. This is the reason that for most purposes arguments or definitions
by induction cannot be performed within the class of sentences, but lead
automatically to formulas with arbitrarily many free variables. The same
applies to the (technical) concept of truth. A remedy for this is to consider
formulas as sentences in a certain extended language.

For Me mainder ol thįs sectįon fiz a language L oJ sįgnature cr-
(C, F, R, °').

A new constant (symbol) for L is any symbol not occurring in the
alphabet of L. We use this terminology only in connection with the following
concept. Given a set of new constants, C, the expansion of L by the new
constants C (or the expansion of L by constants from C, for short),
in symbols L (C), is, by definition, the (uniquely determined) language of
signature (C u C, F, R, °').

Most important is the following particular cǆe. Given a set A of elb
ments of an L-structure M, we choose a netıì constant for every a € A, which

we denote by Q (assuming this latter is not part of the alphabet), and set
= {ţı : a € A}. Then we define the expansion of L by new constants
for A (or the expansion of L by A for short) to be the expansion L (ļ).

For an arbitrary L-structure M and an arbitrary map f : A M, we
denote by (M, f[A]) the L ()-structure in which for all a € A the constant
gı is interpreted by f (a). This becomes somewhat simpler when A C M and
f = idA : the L ()-structure thus obtained is denoted by (M, A). We omit
the underlines if no ambiguity can arise.

Instead of L (d). we write L. () or even L. (A), and similarly for Lï (A).
Generalizing the notation L (A), given any class of formulas A and any
set A of symbols not occurring in A, we Įıse the notation A (A) for the class
of all formulffi obtained from formulas from A by substitution of variables
by elements from A.

Notice, we have (+ n L) (C) = + n L (C) and (qf n L) (C) = qf n L (C)
for the class + of positive formulas and that of quantifier-free formulas, qf
(similarly for any other classes of formulas, like e. g. V, 3, and V3 introduced

(ivi M · ?h A, if M'l and JLĄ t»2,

If M'V, we say that p is true in (or hoıds in or of) JW, or that
M  · satisfıes q.
Our original concern was the truth of sentences in Lstructures. We
make a corresponding definition, more generally, for arbitrary Lfonnulǆ.
Let M be an structure and ã = (ao,... \ an-1) an n-tuple from M (we do
not exclude the case n-O, i. e. â = O).

Given an Lterm-tiTo,..., zn-1), the value of t at ã in J\4, in
symbols t. v (ã), is by definition the element tE(Y w, where JW is as before

if M'Vzo... Tn-l(,..  · tQn-1). We also write M'Vī (ĝ) for the latter.
We extend this notation ǆ follows to arbitrary sets ¢ = {qi (Ē) : i € I}

set M ¢ (ii) in case M Vi (ii) for all i € 1. Correspondingly we sayt ii

24 CHA PTER 3. SEMANTICS
An L-formula or a st  · t of L-fornıulǆ is said to be satisfiable in M, if
UPle satisfies it in AI ; it is said to be satisflable if it is satisfiable in
some nonempty (!) L-structure. (In §3. 3 below we will introduce the concept
of consistency and show that, for sentences this is the same ǆ satisfiability.)
An Lformula is called valid or true in M, in symbols M (P, if
ery tuple in. H (of mat ching length) satisfies v in M. In case V is a
sentence, in accordance with the above, we also say that v holds in (or of)
M. The formula V is called valid or (logically) true, in symbols q, if
u it is \ alid in every nonempty (!) L-structure.
In order to check the validity of a formula in a given structure, one has to
examine all tuples of · matching length.'We exhibited a certain sloppiness in
not specifying 1uhich matching length. We justify this in the remark below
saying that the definition does not depend on the particular length. It turns
out that we can take the number of actually occurring free variables for this
length. Fn particular, in case of sentences we may work with length zero,
i. e., its satisfiability is witnessed by the empty tuple, whence, in a given
structure, there is no difference between the satisfiability and the validity
of sentence. Consequently, a sentence is satisfiable in a nonempty structure
M precisely if it is true in JV. Hence, a sentence hǆ a model if and only if
it is satisfiable.
Remark. (Coincidence Lemma for Satisfiability)
It is clear from the definition of substitution (₩  · 6) that for satisfac-
tion of a formula (p-v(zo,..., zn-1) by a tuple ã = (an,..., aTt-1) only
those indices i count for which xi occurs free in p. That is, given tuples
= (xo,... R£n-I ) and y-(ųo,..., Vm-1 ) of variables, both contain-
ing all the free variables of q, and given tuples ii = (at),..., an-1 ) and
b = (bo,..., bm-1 ) from M, if ai-bj for all those ź < n and j < m for
which zi and yj denote the same variable occurring free in q, we have
M q. (ä) if and only if M Vu (b). We leave the proof of this rather
obvious fact as an exercise.

Another coincidence of interpretations is expressed in the next lemma.
Even though it is rather trivial, we present a proof in order to present, once
for all, a complete proof by induction on the complexity of formulas and
terms. Later we will omit the rather straightforward arguments and give
only hints to the less trivial steps in the induction.

3. 2 Definable sets and relations
Every Lformula 11  · ith n free variables defines an n-place relation in every
Lstructure, Verv often in model theory it is this relation that matters
rather than the actual formula it comes from. Therefore we care about the
syntactic structure of a formula only if it is significant for the relation defined
thereby. In particular two formulas that define the same relation in everv
structure are model-theoretically the same (the technical term to be defined
below is logically equivalent).

We fix the following terminologY and notation. Let M be an L-structure.
Given a E L. (w here n > O), let a (M) denote the set defined by ¢ in JV,
that is. By definition, the set { € AP : M F u (ii) } (w hieh is also known
\ : E M), if it is defined by some U € L.. I. e. A = U (JV). An n-place relation

in M. The thus delined set of n-tuples is called a definable set too. (To
distinguisl : sets definable by 1-place formulas in M from the latter kind
of «lelinable set, we caıled them deñnable subset of M, as opposed to sets
defined by many-place formulas, which are not subsets of M.)

Given (Ē, ý) € Ln+m (where Ē is an n-tuple and an m-tuple of vari-
ables with no variables in common) and an m-tuple č from M, the formula
¢(, ĉ) from L. (M) is called an instance of (Ē, y) (or just a -instance
if the partition of variables is understood). The set defined by it in M, that
is the set {ii € M": M ¢(ii, č) }, is denoted by (M, č). The tuple ĉ is
also known ǆ the parameter (tuple) of this set. Fbrther, a set A C M  ·

Note that for n ś m we can embed L. in L. by adding what is known
as redundant or dummy variables. This means that we ǆsociate with
any formula q-q(zo,..., Tn-1) € L. the formula V'€ L. defined as
qp A (zn = T.) A... A (zm-1-Tm-1). For the corresponding definable
relations we then have qp'(M) = v (M) × Mm-".
Sometimes (when we are not so much interested in the arity) we identify
(p and fp'as above, assuming that redundant variables have been added. This
usually does not lead to problems, as both formulas are logically equivalent
in the sense of the next section. So, in a way, we always may assume
that arities match. Just as well, all substitutions are always assumed to be
matching. In generat, įn aıl TŁotattoTL, lengths ol tuples are assumeď to be

Let E be a set of Lsentences. We defined in §3. ı what it meaiıt for E to
be true (or to hold) in an Lstructure. M. or, qui \ alently, for. RŲ to satisĘ '
E. We introduced, remember, the notation M E for this. If, in addition,
M is not empty, we sav M is a model of E. We use Modi. £, or, if the
context L is understood. simply Mod E. to denote the class of Lstructlıres
that are models of E (i. e. The class of all nonempty Lstructures satisĘw
E)-the model class of E.

Clearly, E can be regarded as a set of sentences in aiıy ıanguage L'ex-
tending L, and so ModL, E is deóned. But note, this class is essentiall. T difter-
ent from Modı. E if L 'L. For example, NoDLO is the class of all nonempty
Structures, while ModL, O is the class of all nonempty し'_structures.

Turning to the central concept of logic. we say that the sentence q
II is a consequence of E. or that E entails V, in symbols'E h. or just
U E þ v, if every nıodel of E is also a model of . For {ť  · } þ q we simply ĦTite
Q þ . We sometimes use the term logical consequence to emphasize that

w e are talking about consequences in the above technical sense--as opposed
to consequences in the every dal T sense, tw _in the metalangue ·

'The symbol thus stands for two difierent relations, that of being a nïo«lel and that
of entaiıment. Which of tlıe two is under consideration is evident from thc context the

We extend these definitions to formulǆ v? (Ĵ) and (Ē) in the obvious
way by applying it to the sets {q} and {}, so that the notations q-M
and V-E ¢ make sense.
The terms t () and s (í) are said to be M-or E-equivalent if the
fomıulas y-t (ř) and y-s () are.
Instead of equivalent we say (logicaıly) equivalent and we write-
instead of_o-
As in the coincidence lemma, in this definition only those entries of ã
are rele \ ant which are substituted for a free variable in ® or W. Thus this
delinition does not depend on n.
Clearly, v (ź) and (ž) are E-equivalent if and only if Eu{} and Eu{tp}
are logically equivaıent (if and only if E VĒ(P H Q)). If these formulas
have the same number of free variables, then they are M-equivalent if and
only if they define the same sets in M. In general, they are M-equivalent
if aiıd only if the latter is true after adding dummy variables appropriately.
It is now easy to write and verify the well-known logical laws as equiva-
lences, e. g.-(Ą û)--V v-Q or (3r V A 3£ )-3zy(q A Q. (y)), in case
y occurs free in neither p nor ¢ ·
We leave it to the reader to find and prove the equivaıences that make
the next remarlts evident.
Rnmarks.
(1) (Disjunctive Normal Forms) Let E be a set of formulas.
Every boolean combination q of formulas from E is logically equivalent
to a formula (in the same free variables) of the form Vi<. Aj<. Qij, °
so-called disjunctive normal form of q, where each qij is from E or
a negation of a formula from E.

(2) Everr quantiïier-free formula is logically equivalent to T, 上, or to a for-
muıa of the form Vi«  · Aj«.. Qij, where the (pıj are literals (i. e. Atomic
or negations of atomic formulas). If we want the same free variables
to occur, then, in the case of quantiĺier-free sentences in languages
without constants, we hatte to allow T and JL, see next remark.
(3) The formulas z-z and z z are equivalent to T and 上, respectiveıy

(note, the latter uses that models are never empty). If there is c € C
then T and 上 are logically equivalent to c-c and c ¢ c, respectively.
Therefore we do not need T and 上 in this case (cf. previous remark).
(4) (Prenex Normal Forms) Every formula is logically equivalent to a for-

mula (with the same tree variables) of the form Qozo... Q.-13n-1 p,
the so-called prenex normal form of tb, where the Qi staııd for quan-
tifiers (tııat is 3 or V) and q is a quantifier-fræ formuıa as in the second

remark above. (By the first half of the previous remark, we can avoid
T and 上 in the formula V by introducing an extra quantifier.)
These normal forms are of course far from being unique.
Given a formula Q in prenex normal form Qozo... Qn-1o-1 ų-the for-
mula q is also known ǆ a (quantifier-free) matrix of fp, while the (quan-
tiñer) prefix of Q is Qozo... Qn-13n-1. In cǆe the quantifier V (resp.
the quantifier 3) does not occur in Q, this formula is called existential
or an 3-formula [read : e-formulai (resp. universal or V-formula [read
a-lormula】). The corresponding classes of formulas are denoted by 3 and
V. Correspondingly, W denotes the class of all formulǱ of the form V q,
where p € 3, while 3V denotes that of formulas 35 91 where p € V, and so
on.

Remark.
(5) Every positive formula is logically equivalent to a formula in prenex

normal form whose matrix is a positive boolean combination of at?mic
formulas.

A contradiction in L is an sentence of the form V A_q. A set of
sentences or a single such sentence is said to be consistent if no consequence
of it (in L) is a contradiction, i. e., if its deductive closure contains no
contradictions. Otherwise the set is said to be inconsistent.

Since no nonempty structure can satisfy a contradiction, the deductive
closure of a contradiction is the set of all sentences (of the language under
consideration). Conversely, if the deductive closure of a set of sentences is
the set of all sentences (of thc language under consideration), it certainly
contains (many) contradictions. Consequently, a set of sentences (or a single
sentence) is consistent if and only if its deductive closure is not the set of
atl sentences (of thc language under consideration).

Similarly, no contradiction has a model, and, conversely, a set of sen-
tences without a model obviously entails ellery sentence (of the language
under consideration).

The next remarks are now immediate.

Remarks.
(6) Every contradiction is inconsistent and logically equivalent to 上. Every

valid sentence is consistent and logically equivalent to T.
(7) A set of sentences is consistent if and only if it has a model.

Next we derive an important semantic property of new constants.

We conchıde tlıis section with Łlnother hǆic ııotion. A cluis K of L-

a seŁ E Ç Lo §uch that K is tlie clǆs of L-structures satisfying E. Wc
then say that E axiomatizes K. In cale E consists of a single sentence
V, i. e. E-{v}, we omit the braces and say, V axiomatizes K. A class
is said to be finitely axiomatizable (in L) if it, can be axiomatized by a
single L-sentence (or, equivalently, by a finite set of those). A theory T is
axiomatized by E if E ç T c E or, ecłlıivalently, the model classes of T
and E are the same.
It is emily seen that the empty set axiomatizcs (in L) the clms of all
L-structures. Further, a clms K is axiomatized by a set E if and only if
the class K U {ØL} is axiomatized by {a V-3r (£-£) げ E E}, and
also if and only if K \ {OL} is axioïTiatized by E U {3z (I-T) }. This
allows us to exclude the empty stnıcture emiıy front discussions related to
axiomatizahility. It also slıows that a class is axiomatizablc if and only if it

V-theories [rcad : a-theorics] are also caıled universal or universally
axiomatizable. Sinıilarly, 3-theories [read : e-theories] are called existen-
tial or existentially axiomatizable. +-theories are also called positive
or positively axiomatizable.

aient. i. e., if and only if EP_T.

Let, conversely, K be axiomatized by E ç Lo. The inclusion from left

It is advisable to understand well the dualism between axiomatizable
classes (as described above) and deductively closed sets of sentences (as
described in Lemma 3. 4. 1 (3)). This is treated in a more systematic way in
the last two exercises (and only for the case without empty structures).

be contained in T, hence T is a maximal theory. Similarly, a maximal theory
is a maximal consistent set.

If M is a model of T, then T Ç Th M. If T is in addition maximal, we
obtain pqualit, y here.

We are left with the implication from the last assertion to the ĥrst. But
this follows easily from the fact that, for every € Lo, either q or-q is
true in M. D

As every consistent set of sentences has a model, we readily derive

Denote by PA the deductive closure of { (P1),..., (P7) } u { (Pq)
L1}. This is consistent and thus a theory, for (N O, l; +,-) is a model.
model is called the staiıdard model of PA.
Gödel's ūrst inconıpleteness theorem says that this theory is incomplete.
入夏 ore precisely, it says that there are true number-theoretic statenıents
in L (włlich means nothing more than true in (N O, l; +,-)) that are not
provable in PA, i. e., PA F Q. Since (N O, l; +,  · ) itself is a model of PA,
we have on the other hand PA -Q. Hence PA is incomplete and thus a
proper subtheory of the Łtheory Th (N O, l; +,-). The latter is also called
true arithnıetic (or conıplete first-order number theory).-Gödel's
theorem is a deep result in mathematical logic, for which we refer the reader
to the standard literature.

3. 6 Empty structures in languages without con-
stants
As in the preceding chapter, we close with a side remark about a'Łrivial'
topic. We mentioned in §1. 2 that there is an empty (T-structure 0. (or an
empty L-struct ure OL) if and only if (T (or L = L (cr)) hǆ no constants. Fix
such a language L. Although also in OL an L-sentence is satisfiable if and
only if it is true in OL (since'there is'an empty tuple, i. e. a O-tuple in
0), due to the lack of tuples of positive length in 0 no formula with free
variables is satisóable in O, while all such formulas are true in OL. For the
same reason Vz V is true in OL for all V € L, while Ĵz V is not. Fbrther, all
Lformulas are OL-equivalent even though some are true in OL and some are
not (note that also in OL, the sentence T is true, while 上 is not).

These anomalies are likely to be the remon that in most logic texts empty struc-
tures are not even considered and that Jz(z-T) became a logical axiom. However,
this exclusion leads to other anomalies, namely in connection with the notion of
generated substnłchıre, cf. §6. 3, and sometimes even to incorrect statements of cer-
tain theorenui, see the example after Theorem 9. 2. 2. Wc do allow empty structures,
but for traditional reasons and in order to avoid the aforementioned semantic sin-
gularities, we exclude empty models (cf. §3. 3) sn that all models satisfy Jr(z-x).
In the definition of truth (§3. 1), however, we did not exclude empty structures so
that the statement OL E makes sense. (Note that this statement is false if E
is a theory, see introduction to §3. 4.) In any cme, all this is no real problem, and
Hodges therefore says, in practice these points netier matter (see p. 42 of his Model
Theory)  ·

Exercise 3. 6. 1. Prove that thc set of L-sentences true in OL i5 neither consistent
nor deductively closed.

Exercise 3. 6. 2. Determine the set of L-sentences tme in OL precisely.

logical e«łuivalence but also equivalence modulo the empty struct\ıre.
