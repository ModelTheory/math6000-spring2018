Part III
Basic properties of theories
The material presented in the previous part was based mostly on some
more or less clever applications of the finiteness theorem in order to produce
models of certain theories. To ensure that these theories expressed what they
were to express we often formulated them using diagrams or interpretations.
We now turn to general properties of theories and more advanced meth-
ods of investigation of the relationship between their models. Fhndamental
here is the notion of elementary embedding between structures of the same
signature (Chapter 8). Cases where this concept simplifies are dealt with in
Chapter 9 about quantifier elimination and related issues (where we prove,
among other things, Hilbert's Nullstellensatz). Chapter 10 finally deals with
iterated elementary embeddings, that is with so-called elementmy chains, a
basic tool of model theory.

Elementary maps
8. 1 Elementary equivalence

Recall from §6. 1 that the L-structures M and N are said to be elementarily
equivalent if M = JV, which is the same as ThM = ThN.

Proposition 6. 1. 3 says, among other things, that isomorphic structures
are elementarily equivalent. We prove first that the converse is true if and
only if the structures under consideration are finite.

proposition 8. 1. 1. The TollouJing are equivalent Tor any L-stmicture M.
) JV 三 M impıįes JV M Jor any L-stmcture N.
N) M is limite.
pTooF The isomorphism type of a structure is uniquely determined by its
diagram.
If M is afinite structure with universe M-{ao,... Tan-1} in a language
of finite signature, then the diagram of M is essentially finite (see Exercise
6. 1. 6). In this cme we can aĵciomatize the diagram by a single sentence
v(Qo,... Tan-1). Then M is, up to isomorphism, the only model of the
sentence 3-"z(z-Æ) A 3Ē v (), and (i) follows.

If the signature of M is infinite, the diagram of M need not be finite
anymore (in the simplest such cme, there could be infinitely many constant
symbols that are interpreted in M by the same element). Then, for any
finite subset A of D (M), we form the conjunction va(ao,..., an-1) of all
sentences in A and see that M is, up to isomorphism, the only model of the
set {3_a(z-z) } u {33 po (Ē) : a @ d (m) l. this implies (i) again.

If, for the converse, M is infinite, then, by Löwenheim-Skolem upward
(Theorem 5. 1. 1), iţs complete theory has arbitrarily large models. As we

Next we deal with the elementarinees of identical inclueioïıß of structures.
Suppose M and Ń are L-structures and A is an arbitrary set of formulas.
We use the notation M a N (or also N a M) to mean that M Ç N
and the following implication holds for all V € n L and matching (possibly
empty) tuples ã from M if Ń P(ä), then M P(iı) ·
In case A contains all of L, we write M N and N M and say, M
is an elementary substructure of N, or N is an elementary extension

of M.

Tivially, M M. Fbrther, M a N is equivalent to (N, M) Ą (M)
(M, M) (cf. The notation in §6. 1).
If ľ is the class of all negations of formulas from A, then we have M A

only if M C N and idM : M N. Fbrther, M N if and only if M C N

defined with parameters from M, this yields v(N, č) n M"_v(M, č) for
all V € Ln+m and č € Mm.
As every elementary embedding is an (isomorphic) embedding, every ele-
mentary substructure is a substructure (and the use of the term is justified).

Proof. (2) and (3) are special cǆes of (1). For the proof of the latter,
suppose f : M N. Take the union of the map f-'(defined on /[Aí】)
with an arbitrary bijection from N \ f[A'ï] onto a set disjoint from M.
Call the resulting map 9 and the image of this map N', Then N'contains
M and g is a bijection from N onto N'extending f-1. Hence gf is an
identical inclusion of AI into N'. Make N'an structure JV'in such a way
that g becomes an isomorphism from JV onto N'(i. e., interpret the non-
logical symbols in N'by the g-images of the interpretations in M. Being an
isomorphism, 9 is an elementary map. By an obvious A-version of Lemma
8. 2. 2 (1), so i5 gf, and we are done. D

The next result shows that, when verifying by induction on the com-
plexity of formulas that an embedding is elementary, all but the existential
quantifier step are trivial.

proof If M N, then M C N and for all Ęo and ã as above we have
(whenever b € M). Therefore, JV 3z p(X, iı) yields b E M such that
M q(b, ã), hence also JV q(b, ä). This proves the easy direction.

For the harder direction, assuming M C N and the condition (TV), we
show by induction on the complexity of tþ € L that
(*) M (iı) iff N (ã)

for all matching tuples Łi from M.

As M C JV, this is true for all atomic . The induction step for con-

Theorem 8. 4. 1. (Löwenheim-Skolem downward for )
Every įīıfiTŁite L-stmcture M has an eıemerıtary substmcture oï a power
Ś ÏLı.
Moreouer, euerg stlbset A ol M ts containeď im am elementary substmc-
turte ol M ol a potıter ś ILI + \AI. Conseqtłently, M has elementary sub-
stnłctunes ol etiery cardinality ñ uJith ILI ś < IMJ.
Proof. The third assertion follows from the second if A is taken to have
power K. The fưst assertion follows from the second if A is taken empty.
Fbrther, all of them are redundant in case IMI < ILI, for then we may take
M M ·
So let A C M and IMI > ILI, and set K-JLI + IAI. Successively we
choose an ascending chain A c Ao c A1 c... C Ai Ç... E < u) of sets
Ai Ç M of power K satisfying
ť) if qp € L1 (Ai) and M 3Æ çp, then there is a € Ai+1 such that M

cp (a),

for all i<u.
We choose the Ai as follows. Start with an arbitrary subset Ao of M of
power containing A. Having chosen Ai, we add to it, for every q (z) from
L (Åi) with M 3z v (=), an arbitrary b, E M with M P(b.), and call
the resulting set Ai+1  ·

As IL (Ai) I = ILI + tAil =. (Corollary 7. 6. 8), we add at most such
elements bp hence K-tAil ś IAi+/I < + tAil = ñ.

Set N = Ui< u Ai. Clearly, N has power n. We are going to show, using
the tarski-vaught test (Corollary 8. 3. 3), that this set is the universe of an
elementarr substructure N ol M.

So let Tı < u, q € Ln+1, and ii an ?ı-tuple from N with M ]z v(£, ã).
We want b € N satisfying M çp(b, ii). But ii is contained already in some
Ak (k < u), as N = Ui«. Ai. Since then P(Æ, ĉi) € L1 (Ak), condition (')
provides us with some b € Ak+r Ç N satisfying M q(b, ii). D

Note that this says nothing about the precise power of elerhentary sub
structures of a power < ILI, and the same applies to the next corollary. ·
Models whose cardinality is smaller than the language are also known as
tiny. It is, in general, a hard and largely open question to find the possible
cardinalities of tiny models.

Proof. Let M be a model of the L-theory T. Every {inite model of T has
power even < LI (i. e. Is tiny). So let T have an infinite model. Then,
for every K > LI, the upward Löwenheim-Skolem yields a model M of T
of power > K. Then the preceding theorem provides us with an elementary
substructure of M of power K. Since the latter i5 elementarily equivalent to
M, it is a model of T too. D
Skolem's paradox. Consider the Zermelo-Fyaenkel set theory ZFC (in the
language L €, cf. §7. 4). If the theory ZFC is consistent (which is unknown but largely
assumed ţo be true), then it has a countable model. By Cantor's theorem 7. 6. 5,
given any set A, its power set has power > IAI. Consequently, this countable model
contains uncountable sets. Tłris seeming contradiction is Skolem's paradox. (For
Skolem it was a reason for serious doubts about axiomatic set theory.) However,
the contradiction is only apparent and carl be resolved as follows. Uncountability
in a model of set theory is not °rea1'(that i5, not metaţheoretical uncountability).
All it means for a set in a model of set theory to be uncountable is that there
is no bijection between that set and the set of natural numbers in tìiat model.
(Remember, set-theoretically functions are just sets, namely graphs.) From this
point of view, Skolem's paradox becomes, on the contrary, very plausible : the less
sets (and hence functions) a model contains, the less bijections will there be with
the set of natural numbers.

lehre, in Proc. 5th Scand. Math. Congress, Helsinki 1922, 217-232]

Applying the upward Löwenheim-Skolem to elementary diagrams, we
obtain arbitrarily large elementary extensions. Letting a downward appli-
cation (of Theorem 8. 4. 1) follow, as in the preceding proof, we can exactly
prescribe the cardinality (but, as before, only in cardinalities that are not

JV ol power K stich that M Ar Tor all M € K. Moreouer, Tor ant/EDen

Proof Consider T-U{Th(m, M) : M € K}, where, without loss ot
generality, for any ţwo different M, M'€ K we may assume that the new
constants {! : a € M} and {Q': a'€ M'} are chosen to be disjoint too (this
can be accomplished by renaming them). It suffices to show that T is con-
sistent. So let A be a finite subset of T. The various occurring elemen-
ţary diagrams are complete theories, hence closed under finite conjunction.
Therefore we may assume that A = {qi : i < n}, where qi € Th(Mi, Mi)
for some Mi € K (i < n) such that Mi ¢ Mj for all i < j < n. Then, for
all i < n, there are a number mi < L【), a formula v € Lmi, and an mi-tuple
äi from Mi such that Vi is of the form v(ĉii). By the disjoint choice of the
constants, also the iįi (as sets) are disjoint. Thus we may assııme the tuples
of variables, i, to be pairwise disjoint as well. But then we have
二(彐面o...歪れー1八年(岳i))蛋一手ヘヨ歪iペ(岳i))
i<n i<n
hence every model of the right-hand conjunction is, after an appropriate
expansion by constants, already a model of A.

So it remains ţo find a model of that conjunction. For all i < rı we
have Vi € Th(Mi, Mi), hence also Mi 3Ēi v(Ēi). Buţ the latter is an
L-sentence, which, by Mo Mi, must be true also in Mo. Thus Mo is a
model of Ą, and T is consistent, as desired.

8. 5 Categoricity and prime models
A theory is said to be categorical in a given power 入 € Cn (or just À-
categorical) if it has, up to isomorphism, exactly one model of power .
An L-theory is said to be categoricaı if it is categorical in some power
ž ILI. We call an L-theory totally categorical if it has infinite models
and every two models of the same power (finite or inĥnite) are isomorphic.

Notice, the definition of -categoricity has two parts : the existence of a
model of power À and the isomorphism of any two models of power , i. e.,
the number of nonisomorphic models of power is 1. There is a subtilty in
the deĥnition of total categoricity : by Löwenheim-Skolem (Corollary 8. 4. 2),
an L-theory is totally categorical if and only if it is categorical in all 入 L】
and also in all 入 < IL in which it has a model ; in other words, if and
only if it has an infinite model and the number of nonisomorphic models in
any given cardinality i51 or O (and for no À L is this number 0.) In
particular, a totally categorical theory is categorical.

related problems, Colıoqium Math. 3 (1954) 58-62]

of completeness and decidability, Koninkl. Ned. Ad. Wettensch. Proc. Ser. A

Proof Since a compıete categorical theory has inlinite models (which can't
be elementarily equivalent to a finite one), no complete categorical theory
has a inite model (cf. Propositions 8. 1. 1 and 8. 1. 2).
For the converse, let T be a 入-categorical L-theory (where 入 ILI)
having no finite models. By Proposition 8. 1. 2, iţ su 伍 ces to show that, given
M, NT, we have MN.
Using Löwenheim-Skolem (8. 4. 2), choose structlıres M'= M and N'.
N such that Im'1 = Vl = 入. The 入-categoricity implies that M'and N'
are isomorphic, hence, by Proposition 6. 1. 3, elementarily equivalent. This
implies also M 三 N. D
Examples.

(1) The theory T_of pure identity is totally categorical, but not complete

(it obviously has in every nonzero cardinality up to isomorphism exactly
one model). Also T is totally categorical ; in particular, it is complete.
(2) The theory DLO__is, by Cantor's theorem, No-categorical, hence com-

plete (since it has no finite models). In one of the exercises below it is
asked for a proof that this theory is noţ categorical in any uncountable

power.
(3) It is proved in Corollary 14. 2. 3 that every complete theory of alg»

braically closed fields is categorical in all uncountable cardinalities.
(4) More examples of categorical theories will be discussed in the exercises.

In his 1954 paper cited above, Loś conjectured that a theory in a counţable
language is categorical in all uncountable cardinalities, once it is categorical irı some
uncountable cardinality. Michael Morley was able to confirm this in 1963. Thus,
for countable complete theories (with infinite models) there are only three possible
kinds of categoricity countably categorical (= No-categorical), but not uncountably
categorical ; uncountably categorical (categorical in all 入 > No), but not countably
categorical ; and totally categorical (categorical in all infinite cardinalities).

124 CHAPTER 8. ELEMENTARY MA PS
The proof of this result is beyond the scope of this text. The reader utay consult
the qlroted literature instead, for instance Hodges'shorter model theory. It should
be ıroted, tlıough, t, hat hlorley's deep result wm tlıe starting point for st. Abilit, y
(or cıǆsification) theory-ǆ developed by Saharon Shelah---which constitutes the
heart of contemporary model theory (see also §15. 8).
In §5. 3 we noted that every ħeld contains a prime ĥeld, which depends
only on t, he given characteristic. This leads to the following definitions.
Let K be a class of L-structures. An L-structure M is said to be a
prime structure for K, if M JV for all JV € K. Let T be an L-theory.
An L-structure M i5 said to be an algebraically prime model of T, if M
is both, a model of T and a prime structure for Mod T. An L-structure M
is called an elementarily prime modelż of T, if M . N for all JV T.
Clearly, an elementarily prime model of T is itself a model of T.
Examples.
(6) The field Q is a prime structure (a prime field) for the class of fields
of characteristic 0. The field F, is a prime structure (a prime field) for
the class of fields of characteristic p.

(6) The field Q is an algebraically prime model of the theory TFo of all

fields of characteristic 0. Similarly, Fp is an algebraically prime model
of the theory TF, of all fields of characteristic p.

(7) Every countably infinite set is, by Proposition 8. 3. 5 (1), an elementarily

prime model of To. Every finite set is a prinıe structure for the model
class of T. (Somewhat pathologically, even the empty set is a prime
structure for Mod T.. For L_has no constant symbols.) Since the
empty set i5 not a model,'the'one-element set (a singleton) is the
algebraically prime model of T_.
(8) The standard model N of Peano arithmetic is an elementarily prime

model of true arithmetic Th N, see Exercise 13. 2. 3 below (and cf. §3. 5).
(9) If L is a language without constant symbols, then the empty L-structure

is a prime structure for every class of L-structures.

Remarks.
(1) Prime models have cardinality < ILI.

(2) Every elementarily prime model is an algebraically prime model.
(3) Any theory with an elemenŁarily prime model is complete.

(4) Every countable No-categorical theory without finite models has an

elementarily prime model, namely'the'countable model.

2, ľhc attributes algebraicalıy and elementaĦly are to indicate with respect to which kind
of maps we require embeddabiïity, just (algebraic) embeddings or elementary embeddings.

Proof Ad (3). If a theory has an elementarily prime model, then the latter is
elementarily embeddable in, hence equivalent to every model of that theory.
Consequently, all of its models are elementarily equivalent, and the theory
is complete.

Ad (4). By Löwenheim-Skolenı, every model of a counţable theory has
a countably infinite elementary substructure. If the theory under consid-
