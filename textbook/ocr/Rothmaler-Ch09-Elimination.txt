Elimination

In the preservation theorems of §6. 2 we found conditions for formulas to be
equient (logically or modulo a given theory) ţo formulas of a particular
form. In this chapter we investigate what it means for a theory that all
formulǆ be, modulo that theory, equivalent to formulǆ of a particular form.
9. 1 Elimination in general

Given a class of formulas, A, and a theory T, we say that T admits (or has)
elimination up to formulas from A (or simply A-elimination), if every
formula çp € L. is T-equivalent to a formula Ô € Ą n L. (i. e. T V ko H

ô))  ·

ǳmark. Suppose T and T'are theories in the same language and T Ç T'.
If T has A-elimination, so does T'.

Of particular interest is the case where A is closed under boolean com-
binations. If it is not, we therefore pǆs to its boolean closure À, i. e. The
class of all boolean combinations of formulas from A. We first investigate
źi-elimination of sentences.
Lenıma 9. 1. 1. Suppose E C Lo, tp is a sentence in Lo, h is an arbitrary
class ol Jomuıas, and Ż its boolearŁ cįo 51ıre.
TherŁ (p is E-equivalent to T, to , or to a formula from 2 n Lo įf and
only if M =& N implies M 三 q N, for aıl M, N F E.
Proof Since M za Ń implies M z2Ĺ N (even in the case A-O), the
direction from left to right is clear.

9. 2 Quantifier elimination
Elimination up to quantińer-free formulas, i. e. Qf-elimination, is not sur-
prisingly called quantifıer elimination. Moduıo theories with quantifier
elimination one can do without quantifiers. In particular, all sentences are
equivalent to quantifier-free ones. As by Lemma 6. 1. 1, quantifier-free sen-
tences are preserved both ways,'going up'and'going down', we see that two
models of a theory with quantifier elimination are elementarily equivalent,
provided there i5 a structure (of the same signature) embeddable in both of
them. We can derive somewhat more from Lemma 6. 1. 1.
Remarks.
(1) A theory with quantifier elimination whose model clǆs has a prime
structure is complete. In particular, any theory with quantifier elimi-
nation in a language without constants is complete, cf. Example (9) in
§8. 5

W hether a theory admits quantifier elimination depends on Lhc language
it is formulated in. One can alw ays achieve it b artificially'adding'all
formulas to the signature. Xiore precisely, giv en an Ltheor. V T, consider thc
extension L'of L by a new Tz-ary relation R. for every V € L.. (n < u).
Following Hodges we call the set of L'_sentences T'_T U {V (R. () H
q ()) : q-q () € L} an atomization'of T.

The atomization T of an Ltheory T is a theory with quantifier elim-
ination (exercise!). Fbrther, the reduction map r L constitutes a bijec-
tion betn-een Mod T and Aiod T. This bijection preserves isomorphism
t}pes in both directions, I. e., it maps isomorphic L"_structures to isomor-
phic Lstructures, and nonisomorphic ones to nonisomorphic ones. Fbrther,
M-F T and M = M"r L have the same definable sets. Moreover,
JW AP iff JV N (where JV'F T and JV = N'r L). That this map is

surjective is immediate, for each M F T can be expanded to M"F T  · by
simply interpreting Rv in M by q. Thus T  · is consistent. The rest follows
from the fact that the map defined by V H Rq, from the Lindenbaum-Tarski
algebra of T to that of P, is an embedding (of boolean algebras) satisfying
T F 3z R+( ·  · y) (£, ) H Ra. (  ·  · y) (). We leave the verification of all these
assertions as an exercise.
The upshot of this discussion is that if one is interested only in the
investigation of the models of T in terms of their definable sets (no matter
koto these are defined) and elementary maps between them, one can as well
pass to the atomization T, a theory with quantifier p. limination.

Atomization yields an abundance of theories having quantifier elimina-
tion. In due course we will investigate some less trivial examples. Before
we can do so we need a criterion for quantifier elimination, and for that, in
turn, some more terminology.

Let K be an arbitrary class of structures. An Ltheory T is said to be K-
complete if, for every model M F T and every substructure A C M which
is a member of K, the deductive closure of T u D (A) is a complete L (A)-
theory. In case K is the class of all structures, this is called substructure-
completeness.

'Atomizations are also known as Morleyizations or Morley expansions.

(3) An tlıeory T is substructure-complete ifï, for all L-structures A, the

consistency of T u D (A) implies its completeness.
(4) By Proposition 8. 1. 2 (and isomorphic correction), T is K-coinplete if

and only if, for any two models M, N T having a joint substructure
A € K, we have (M, A) = (N, A).
(5) A K-complete theory T has the following elementary amalgamation

A primitive formula is, by definition, a formula of the form 3È ¢, where
Q is a conjunction of literals ; here may be empty. (Positive primitive
means that no negated atomic formulas may occur in , cf. 4. 2. 1.) We call
a formula simply primitive if it is a primitive formula with only one exis-
tential quantifier, i. e. a formula of the form 3z , where is a conjunction
of literals. We denote the clms of simply primitive formulas by 3  · .

It is easy to see that 3Ē (V v ) and 35 q v 35 are logically equivalent.
Therefore, a formula is (equivalent to) an 3-formula if and only if it is
equivalent to a disjunction of simply primitive formulas.

PTool. For the nontrivial direction, assume that every simply primitive
formula is T-equivalent to a quantifier-free L-formula. Inductiveıy on the
complexity. of V € L we show that p is T-equivalent to a quantifier-ħee
formula. The initial step q € at is trivial. The inductive steps involving
conjunction and negation are trivial as well, as conjunctions and negations
of quantilier-free formulas are quantifier-free, and replacing subformulas by
equivalent ones does not afïect the equivalence.

We are left with the cǆe that V is of the form 3y 0(2, y) and 0(Ē, y) is, by
induction hypothesis, T-equivalent to a quantifier-free L-formula ý(, y) €
qf. As noted above, 3y V, i(Ē, y) is logically equivalent to V, Ĵyi(Ē, y).
Since qf is closed under disjunction, we may therefore assume that (, y) is
a conj unction of atomic and negated atomic formulǆ, i. e. That 3y ¢(ič,  · y) is
a simply primitive formula. By hypothesis, these formulas are T-equivalent
to a quantifier-free L-formula, and the same is true for q. D

Remark.
(9) (About languages without constants.) Suppose T is a theory with
quantffier elimination in a language L without constants. We know
from Remark (1) above that T is complete. One can also derive this
from Remark (T)-invoking the previous theorem. Here is yet another
proof. Bv Remark (3) of §2. 5 all quantifier-free sentences are logically
equivalent to T or 上. Since T is true in every structure, while 上 is
true in none, we infer that all models of T are elementarily equivalent,
whence T is complete.

The next example shows that the preceding theorem becomes false if in
the concept of substructur»completeness empty (sub-) structures are ex-
eluded.

9. 2. Q UA NTIFIER ELIAMNATION 135
Example. Let L be the language (without constants) whose only non-
logical symbol is a predicate P. Let further Tp be the Łtheory omatized
the sentence VÆ P( · ) V VÆ-P (z). The models of Tp are exactly those
infinite sets, all of whose elements satisfy P or all of whose elements satisfy
ĦP. Thus Tp is not complete, hence, by the preceding remark, cannot have
quantifier elimination. (One can see this directly : the sentences V£ P (£) and
3a P( · ) cannot be TF-equivalent to a quantifier-ħee formula.) However, if
A is a nonempty substructure of a model of Tp (e. g. a singleton) then
TP U D (A) is complete, since depending on whether Vz P (£) or V£-P( · )
holds true in A, one of these sentences already Jollo1ıJs from Tp U D (A). If
one would not allow empty structures, TP would be substructure-complete
without having quantifier elimination.
We conclude this section with a characterization of complete theories of
Jinite structures having quantifier elimination in terms of extendability of
isomorphisms. To this end, a structure M is said to be ultrahomogeneous
if every isomorphism between finitely generated substructures of M can be
extended to an automorphism of M.
Corollary 9. 2. 3. Let M be a Jinite, but ?ıonempty struchłre.

THM admits quantiFer ełiminatioTı įf and oTLIy įí M is ultrahomoge-
neolıs.

Proof. Assume first that T-Th M hǆ quantifier elimination. Let A and
B be isomorphic substructures of M. This means nothing more than that
(M, A) and (M, B) are models of T U D (A). Substructurķcompleteness
now implies (M, A) = (M, B). As both struct\ıres are finite, this yields an
isomorphism h : (M, A) ¥ (M, B). But, tllis just means that / ı € Aut M
and h[A] ー ı3. This argument can bc easily modiĺied to yield the full
ultrahomogeneity of M (which is left m iln cxttrcise).

Assume now that M is ultrahomogeneous. Given A Ç M, we will prove
(N, B) = (M, II) for every model (N, B) of T U D (A), Such a set B is ilie
universe of a substructure ß that is isomorphic to A. Since M is finite, N
is isomorphic to M. Now it remains to extend the isomorphism between B
and A to an automorphism of M to infer that (M, B) ¥ (M, A), hence also
(M, B) = (M, Jļ) D

Example. By Exercise 15. 1. 2 below, all finite cycıic groups are ultrahomo-
geneous.

eay about t lld other dense linear orderings.

9. 4 A1gebraically closed fields
We now turn to the most prominent example, which essentially motivated
model-theoretic concepts and results. The quantifier elimination for alg
braically closed fields, which we are to verify first, will prove to be a useful
tool : it immediately yields a number of classical algebraic results, ǆ we will
see in the next section.

The theory we have to deal with is the theory ACF of algebraically
closed fıelds, iomatized by the set of axioms

TFU {Vyo... y.-13×(z"+ yn-l£ TZ-'+... + y】+ yo-0) : O<n< b}}.
As tn §5. 3, we tuork in tite language L = L(0, 1 ; +,-,  · ) wìıeneuer we deal
utįth Jĺelďs (or rings).

The models of this theory are precisely the ĥelds in which every poly-
nomial of positive degree (in one indeterminate) and with coefficients from
the given field have a root. Such fields are said to be algebraically closed
(Note that, in the axioms ACF, we required the existence of a root, only
for monic polynomials of positive degree, i. e. For polynomials of positive
degree whose leading coefficient is 1 ; however, this is no restriction, as
the coefficient ring is a ĥeld.)

Remark. ACF has only infinite models, for if /c is a ĥnite field with universe
{ki : i < n}, then the polynomial 1 + Hi«. (z-ki) can have no root in K.
Adding the axiom about a positive characteristic p or infinitely many
axioms about characteristic O (see §5. 3), we obtain the extensions ACF,-
ACF U TFp and ACFo-ACF U TFo ·

9. 4. ALGEBRAICAŁLY CLOSED FıEI, DS 139
Example. Giulss 'so-cMled Jtłntlamental tlłeorem ol algebra saye that the
field of complex nutııbers C is a model of ACF (lıence also of ACFo). Thc
lields Q aiıd m (of the ratioīıals and tlıc rcals, respectively) are not alge-
braically closed : e. g. z2 + 1 has no root in them.
Let us recall some material concerning polynomials in one indeterminate over
a ield K (i. e. with coeñi cients from that field). Such a polynomial is a term of the
form k. z"+ kn-lz"-'+... +krz+ko, where ki € K (i < n) (it is indeed a term in
the formal sense of §2. 2 if we regard it as being in thc language L (K)). Under the
usual operations these polynomials form the so-called polynomial ring K[z] over
K. If f is the polynomial above and k. ł O, then n is the degree of f, denoted
by deg f. If ko =...-k.-O, that is f = O, we set deg f =-oo. Usually the
polynomiaJs of degree ś 0 in ) C[  · ] are identified with the elements of the field /c,
which is thus regarded as a subring of K[  · ]. The constant polynomia10 € /c is the
zero of the ring ìc[  · ], while the constant polynomial 1 € K is its one. If a is a root
of a poıynomiaı of positive degree from lc[  · ] in a certain extension field E of K, then
a minimal polynomial of a over /c is a monic polynomial f E K[ß] of minimal
degree having a as a root. (We will see shortly that this does not depend on E.)
Since the difïerence of two manic polynomials of the same degree is a polynomial
of lesser degree, there is exactly one minimal polynomial of a. More can be said,
once it is taken into account that K[z] is a euclidean ring, i. e., given nonzero
polynomials 9 : f € ) C[z], there are polynomials q, r € K[  · ] such that g-qf + r
and degr < degf. ħom this one easily sees that a nonzero polynomial from / c[z]
with a root a € JC is divisible by Æ-a in ìc[  · ]. By induction on the degree one can
further show that a nonzero polynomial g Ē /c[z] has at most degg roots. (This
implies in turn that over an injinite field /c only the polynomials of degree ś O, i. e.
only the elements from /c, can be constant (ǆ a function from JC to /c). In İinite
fields this is difrerent the so-called obenius map on 】Fp, given by z H £P, is the
identical map, i. e., the polynomial zp_z is constantly 0.) It follows from tc[  · ]
being euclidean that the minimal polynomiaJ f of a over /c divides every polynomial
g E ìc[z] that has a as a root. For if g-qf + r as before, a is a root also of r,
hence r-O, as deg r < deg f (otherwise one could make r monic, contradicting the
minimality of f). This implies that all roots of the minimal polynomial f of a over
/c (in any extension Iield of K) are roots aJso of every polynomial in K[  · ] that has a
as a root. ĺbrther, the minimal polynomial f of a over K is irreducible (in /c[z]),
i. e., if f is a product of polynomials h, Tï e ) C[×], then íl E K or l2 E /c (i. e.
Ciegh-0 or deg l2 = 0). This is so, since f (a) = O implies h (a) = 0 or l2 (a) = O,
as E has no zero-divisors ; however, deg f = deg ll + deg l2, hence the minimality
of f yields ciegh-0 or degjz = 0. Together with the aforementioned feature of
sets of roots of minimaJ polynomiaJs, this shows that f is a minima, 1 polynomial of

Proof. By the above remark about quotient fields we niay assume tlıat A
itself is a óeld. i. e. A = Q (A).

Being a quantilier-{ree formula. ť  · is a boolean combination of atomic
formulas. It is emy to see that it suffices to consider the cǆe, witcre V'
consists of one disjunct only. By Leinma 5. 3. 3 (2). ų', may be taken of the

torm

A ti (z) = OA A sj (T) 0 (ti 1 sj € At  · D.
i<m j<n

A polynomial equation a-O with a constant polynoïııiaı a € A is satisfied
either simultaneously in all fields K J A (namely if and only if a-0) or else
in no field K A at all. Since the same holds true also for boolean combi-
nations of such eouations, the lemma is proved for sentences Q. Moreover,
any conjunct of the form a-0 or Q + 0 is redundant or makes the formula
inconsistent. Therefore we may assume that all occurring polynomials ti
and sj have positive degree. We consider two cases.

Case ı m-0. This means that ¢ is logically equivalent to the formula
-Vj< n sj (z) = 0. Then, in any field K J A, the set jc \ Q (K) is the union
of the (ñnitely many) sets of roots of the sj, hence (b) holds.

Case 2 m > 0. Assume (a) and (b) do not hold. Then ¢ is satisfied by
an element c of some field extension /c J A. As m > 0. The element c is a
root of a polynomial of positive degree and thus has a minimal polynomial
f over A. The roots of f arhas explained abovroots of all polynomials
ti (i < m), but of no polynomial sj (j < n) (for c is no root of any of the
sj). Consequently, all roots of f satisfy tp (in all field extensions of A), i. e.,
(c) takes place.

Now that this trichotomy is verified, suppose A C K'ACF and is
Satisfied n some field /c J A. Then we are in (b) or (c). In case (c), UC')
contains all roots of f in /c'. But this field is algebraically closed, hence f
does have a root therein. In case (b), /c'\ Q (K') is finite. But being an
algebraically cıosed fieıd, K'is infinite (see Remark above), hence Quc')
can't be empty either D

On a more formal level, tıris means that for every /c TF the set
ACF U D (K) is consistent. This is a well-known algebraic fact. Assrıming
it ĺor the moment, we want to derive now some deeper algebraic results
from the material of the previotıs section. We postpone a (semntaiııed)
proof of the above fact until Exercise 12. 1. 4. (Moreover, in Exercise 12. 1. 5
a famous theorem of Steinitz about algebraic closure, wHch has the above
fact as a consequence, is to be derived from our much more general-model-
theoreticonsiderations. This topic will be resumed in Chapter 11.)

Proof. Suppose cr has a solution in a certain field JC') C and K C ľ
ACF. We have to show, cr has a solution in K'.

By the above fact there is an algebraically closed field K ır K ı. Since (T
is quantffier-free with parameters in /c, to have a solution is an ejstential
statement and thus passes up to K". Hence ACF u D (K) u {32 a} is consis-
tent. But the substructur»completeness of ACF implies the conıpleteness
of ACF U DOC). Consequently, ACF U DOC) 35 cr (í), as desired. D

Now we can give a proof of a classical theorem that is fundamental in
algebraic geometry. The previous lemma constitutes-in our treatment-
the model-theoretic part of it, while the remaining part is purely algebraic

Invoking Zonı's lemma, ĺirht rłtoose a maximal ideaı 11 in 73 containing
the l.. Tīıen K'_def R/. \l ih a field. It is ťĮsil.''seen that k-/ +,\l [lefin
a ring homomorphisnı / ı : /c-K'with kernpl /cnA  · t. Note that. \ 1 contains
no invertible elements (otııerwise t wouıd ıie in, \l, contradicting 71 ¢ M).
Hence /c n M = {o}, i. e. /ı : K c K'. This embedding canonicalıy induces
an embedding lc[ŕ] K'[ŕ], which we denote bv h again.
Now we show that (zo+M,-... T.-1 +. \l) is a root of each of the poıyn»
mials h (Jo),.... / ı(f.-ı ) in K'. Herp we identify, for simplicity, polynomials
from K[È] with their h-images in K'[ì] ·
A t1tical element of / C'is of the form T + Af. where T E 72. Tłıe
arithmetical operations in /c'are (T + M) + (s + AI) = ( · + s) + Af and
( · + A!)  · (, q + AI) = (T  · S) + Af. where T., 5 € 71. Hence we have f(fu +

every i < m (ǆ li € M). But O+Aİ is the zero of the field K'. Consecłuentl.'',

By isomorphic correction one can ĥnally make /c'contain / C. D
Remark. The ideal generated by a (single) polynomial f € K[z] i5 thp
entire ring /c[z】 if and only if there is a polynomial g É tc[z】 such that f9 = 1,
i. e. If and only if f has degree 0. Thus the Hilbert Nullste1ıensatz generalizes
in two\Ą'ays the defining property or algebraically closed fields (that every
polynomial in K[  · ] of positive degree have a root in every algebraically closed
field extension oF K) : to finitely many polynomials and to (finitely) many
indeterminates.
By the way, the Nullstellensatz does not require the full strength oł
quantifier elimination of the theory ACF, but only its so-called model-
completeness, as is (o be shown in Exercise 9. 6. 2 below. Our next appli-

Proof If X Ç /c"is defined by P(ZO,..., zn-1), then its projection e. g-onto
the last n-1 components is delined by Ĵxop(ZO,..., zn-]). But the latter
is, by quantifier elimination, ACF-equivalent to a quantifier-free formula,
hence defines a constructible set in W. D
Remark. The proof yields a strengthening of Chevalley's theorem for ev-
ery ĘQ(O,..  · 13n-1) there is a quantifier-free (£1,... 1on-1) defining the
projection of v (W) onto T1t... Tzn-1 not only in one, but simultaneously

Let /c ACF. A function f : K"K-is said to be constructible

defines in K a function È H ý if and only if it does so in any other lield

This is another conóequence of the quantióer elimination for ACF, or

9. 6 Model-completeness

Consider the following weakening of substructure-completeness. A theory T
is said to be model-complete if it is Mod T-complete (see §9. 2).

[binson, A. : Complete Theories, Studies in Logic and the Foundations of
Mathematics, North-Holland, Amsterdam, 1956]

We are going to show that model-completeness is equivalent to a ı  · eaker
elimination property, namely to 3-elimination, and, equivalent ly, also to V-
elimination. There is another interesting equivalent, for which we introduce

another concept.
Given. L-structures M Ç N, we say that M is existentially closed in
N if JV v (łı) implies M p (ã) for every existential Lformula q () and
every matching tuple ä from M, i. e. If M Ĵ N (cf. Notation in ₩. 3). M
is said to be existentially closed in a given class of structures, K, if
M € K and M is existentially closed in every N € K with M C N. An
existentially closed model of a theory T is, by definition, a model of T
that is existentially closed for the class Mod T.
Remarks.
(1) As mentioned before Lemma 9. 2. 1, every 3-formula is logically equiva-
lent to a disjunction of primitive formulas. Therefore for the existential
closedness of M in N J M it suffices to check primitive formuıas.
(2) A primitive formula is of the form 3Ē cT(, ), where cr is a conjunction of

literals. In languages without relation symbols the latter are just term

equations and inequations. Hence in this case the existential closedness
of JM in N M means that every finite system cr of equations and
inequations with parameters from M is solvable in M whenever it it
is solvable in N. Thus Lemma 9. 5. 1 implies that algebraically closed
fields are existentially closed (in the class of all fields). 3 Since every
polynomial of positive degree in one indeterminate with coefficients
from a given field has a solution in alı extension field (use e. g. Kro-
necker's construction from the proof of the Nullstellensatz), we infer
that, conversely, every existentially closed field is algebraically closed.
Thus for fields both notions coincide (where existentially closed field
is to mean ° existentially closed in the class of fields').
Next we prove an extended analogue of Theorem 9. 2. 2. The implication
(iv) 4 (i) is known as Robinson's model-completeïıess test.
Theorem 9. 6. 1. (A. Robinson) For euery theory T the Tolloluing are eqtıiu-

Proof (i) 4 (ii). Clearly, (M, M) is a model of TuD (M). If f : M JV
and M, N T, also (N, f[M]) is a model of T U D (M). Its completeness
(given by hypothesis) yields (M, M)-(N, f[M]), whence f is elementary.

(iv) 4 (vi). Since the V-formulas are (up to logical equivalence) exactly
the negations of 3-formulas, M Ĵ N if and only if for all V-formulas ()
and all matching ä from M we have ţhe implication if M tþ(ii), then
N ý (ä). Corollary 6. 2. 6 then implies that all V-formulas are T-equivalent
to 3-formulas.

In order to show that eitery formula fp is T-equivalent to an 3-formula,
we proceed by induction on the complexity of q. The initial step is, as
well as the quantifier step, is trivial. But so is also the conjunction stepi
as 35q (Ē) A ĴyQ (y) is logically equivalent to 3g (qo(Ē) A ()). We'are

Remarks.

(3) Also for model-complete theories the two notions of prime model coin-

eide, and we just say prime model.
(4) (Prime Model Test)

Every modeı-complete theory with a prime model is complete.

One of the exercises below shows that finite linear orderings with more
than one element are examples of complete and model-complete theories
that do not admit quantiĥer elimination.
Example. (A complete, model-complete theory with infinite models that
does not have quantiĥer elimination.)

exactly three irreflexive points, and alı reflexive points are isolated),

It folıows from (R1) and (R2) that there are at most two nonisolated points.
Together with (R3) this yields exactly two nonisolated points. The models
of T thus difĺer from. At moet in the nurııber of relıeriue points (related
to themselves). Hence every model. /v of T has power 3 and, in case
N is finite, exactly ıNı-3 rellexive points. Consequently, T is totally
categorical. Then T°o is totally categońcaı, and hence complete. A point of
a substructure A of a model N of T is reHexive in A if aııd only if it is so iıı
N. Hence in case A T aļl three irreßexive points of. TV must be irreĤexive

But T°c is not substructurmompıete : we claim that TuD (B) is not com
plete for the substructure B that consists of a single. IrreHexive point. For,
the substructures of M on the universe {0} and on the universe {1} are both
isomorphic to ı3, hence (M, O) and (M, 1) are models of TuD (B). However,
they are not elementariıy equivalent, as M V3/-R(O, y) A ĵyR(1, y)  ·
