\section{Signatures, Languages, Terms, Formulas, Sentences}\label{signatures-languages-terms-formulas-sentences}

\subsection{Signatures}\label{signatures}

A \defn{signature} 𝑆 = (𝑪, 𝑭, 𝑹, ρ) consists of three (possibly empty) sets 𝑪, 𝑭, and 𝑹 of \emph{constant},
\emph{function}, and \emph{relation} symbols (resp.), along with a function
ρ : 𝑪 + 𝑭 + 𝑹 → ℕ that assigns an \emph{arity} to each symbol.

\subsection{Languages}\label{languages}
The \defn{language} 𝐿 = 𝐿(𝑆) of signature 𝑆 is a certain collection of strings
of symbols from the following \defn{alphabet} of symbols:
\begin{enumerate}
\item  \defn{logical symbols}:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item \emph{logical connectives}: ¬ , ∧ , ∨ , ⊤ , ⊥ (for ``negation,''
    ``conjunction,'' ``disjunction,'' ``true,'' ``false,'' resp.),
  \item \emph{existential quantifier}: ∃
  \item \emph{equality}: =
  \end{enumerate}
\item \defn{variable symbols} (countably many)
\item \defn{non-logical symbols} from 𝑆 (the constant, function, and relation symbols)
\item \defn{parentheses}: ( , ).
\end{enumerate}
We often denote the (countable) set of variable symbols by 𝑋.
To specify which strings of symbols belong to the language 𝐿 we must define the
\emph{terms} and \emph{formulas} of 𝑆 (called 𝑆-terms and 𝑆-formulas,
respectively). Eventually, we will \emph{define} 𝐿 as follows:
\begin{quote}
\emph{The language 𝐿 is the set of all 𝑆-formulas.}
\end{quote}





\subsection{Terms}\label{terms}
The set \(\operatorname{Term}_S(X)\) of \defn{terms} in
the signature 𝑆 generated by
the set 𝑋 of variable symbols is defined recursively as follows:\footnote{The
  set \(\operatorname{Term}_S(X)\) may be denoted by \(\operatorname{Term}(X)\)
  when the signature is clear from the context, and the members of this set go
  by the following synonymous names: 𝑆-\defn{terms}, 𝐿(𝑆)-terms, or 𝐿-terms.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item All variables symbols (in 𝑋) are 𝑆-terms.
\item All constant symbols (in 𝑪) are 𝑆-terms.
\item If 𝑓 ∈ 𝑭 and 𝑡 is a sequence of 𝑆-terms of length ρ 𝑓, then 𝑓 𝑡 = 𝑓(𝑡₀, 𝑡₁, …) is an 𝑆-term.
\item Any string of symbols that can be obtained in finitely many steps from some
combination of 1, 2, and 3 above is an 𝑆-term.
\end{enumerate}






\subsection{Formulas}\label{formulas}
The \defn{formulas} of 𝑆 (also known as 𝑆-formulas, or 𝐿(𝑆)-formulas, or 𝐿-formulas) are defined recursively as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item ⊤ and ⊥ are 𝑆-formulas (the ``trivially true'' and ``trivially false'' formulas).
\item If 𝑠 and 𝑡 are 𝑆-terms, then 𝑠 = 𝑡 is an 𝑆-formula.
\item If 𝑟 ∈ 𝑹 and 𝑡 is a sequence of 𝑆-terms of length ρ 𝑟, then
      𝑟 𝑡 = 𝑟 (𝑡₀, 𝑡₁, … ) is an 𝑆-formula.
\item If φ and ψ are 𝑆-formulas and 𝑥 ∈ 𝑋, then ¬ φ, φ ∧ ψ, and ∃ 𝑥 φ are 𝑆-formulas.
\item Any string of symbols that can be obtained in finitely many steps
      from some combination of 1--4 above is an 𝑆-formula.
\end{enumerate}
The \defn{language of the signature} 𝑆, denoted 𝐿(𝑆) (or just 𝐿), is the set of all 𝑆-formulas.



\subsection{Sentences}\label{sentences}
A variable is \defn{bound} if it is captured by (falls within the scope of) a
quantifier or a λ. For example, x and y are bound and z is free in the following
formulas: (∀ x)(∃ y)(x = z + y), and λ~x~y (x~+~y~+~z) = λ y (z + λ x (x + y)).
\begin{enumerate}
\item
  A term 𝑡 is said to be \defn{constant} (or \defn{closed}) if
  it contains no variables.
\item
  A formula φ is called a \defn{sentence} (or \defn{closed
  formula}) if it contains no \emph{free} variables; that is,
  all variables appearing in φ are bound.
\item
  𝐿₀ := all sentences in the language 𝐿 (aka ``𝐿-sentences'');
\item
  An \defn{atomic} 𝐿-formula has one of the following two forms:
  \begin{enumerate} 
  \item 𝑠 = 𝑡, where 𝑠 and 𝑡 are 𝐿-terms;
  \item 𝑟 𝑡, where 𝑟 ∈ 𝑹 and 𝑡 is a sequence of 𝐿-terms of length ρ 𝑟.
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  \(\mathbf{at}_L\) (or just \(\mathbf{at}\) when the context makes
  𝐿 clear) is the class of all atomic 𝐿-formulas.
\item
  An \defn{atomic} 𝐿-sentence is either an equation of constant
  terms or a relational sentence, \(R(t_0, \dots, t_{n-1})\), where all
  \(t_i\) are closed terms;
\item
  A \defn{literal} 𝐿-formula (or, 𝐿-\defn{literal}) is an
  atomic or negated atomic 𝐿-formula;
\item
  \(\mathbf{lt}_L:=\) the set of all 𝐿-\defn{literals}; that is,
  \(\mathbf{at}_L \cup \{¬ φ : φ \in \mathbf{at}_L\}\);
\item
  \(\mathbf{cl}_L:=\) the set of all \defn{closed}
  𝐿-\defn{literals} (literal 𝐿-sentences; that is, literals
  without free variables).
\end{enumerate}
\begin{remarks*}\
\begin{enumerate}
\item Every constant symbol is a constant term.
\item An atomic sentence contains no variables at all.
\item \emph{Languages without constant symbols have no atomic sentences.}
\item Every language comes equipped with a countable supply of variables, so the
      cardinality of 𝐿 is |𝐿| = max \{ℵ₀, | 𝑪 ∪ 𝑭 ∪ 𝑹 |\}.
\end{enumerate}
\end{remarks*}

\section{Boolean comibinations and quantifier-free formulas}\label{boolean-comibinations-and-quantifier-free-formulas}

Let ℰ be a set of formulas.

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  A \defn{boolean combination} of ℰ is obtained by connecting formulas from ℰ
  using only connectives from \{∧, ∨, ¬\}.
\item
  A \defn{positive boolean combination} of ℰ is obtained by connecting formulas
  from ℰ using only connectives from \{∧, ∨\}.
\item
  The \defn{boolean closure} of ℰ is the set \(\tilde{ℰ}\) of all boolean combinations of
  formulas from ℰ.
\item
  A \defn{positive} formula is obtained from atomic formulas using
  only connectives or quantifiers from \(\{∧, ∨, ∃, ∀\}\).
\item The class of all positive formulas (of all possible languages) is denoted by \(\boldsymbol{+}\).
\item A \defn{negative} formula is a negated positive formula, and the class
  of such is denoted by \(\boldsymbol{-}\).
\item A \defn{quantifier-free} formula is one with no quantifiers.
\item The class of all quantilier-free formulas (of arbitrary signature) is
  denoted by \(\mathbf{qf}\).
\end{enumerate}
\begin{remarks*}\
\begin{enumerate}
\item In the definition of boolean combinations, we could allow → and ←; we
  could do without ∨.
\item Formulas in \(\mathbf{qf}\) have no occurrences of ∃ or ∀; ⊤ and ⊥ are
  such formulas, so ⊤, ⊥ ∈ \(\mathbf{qf}\).
\item \(\mathbf{qf}\) is the class of all boolean combinations of atomic formulas.
\end{enumerate}
\end{remarks*}

\section{Expansion by Constants, Validity, Truth}\label{expansion-by-constants-validity-truth}

Fix a signature 𝑆 = (𝑪, 𝑭, 𝑹, ρ) and a let
\begin{itemize}
\item 
  𝐿 = 𝐿(𝑆), the language of 𝑆;
\item 
  Δ = an arbitrary class of formulas (not necessarily from 𝐿);
\item
  ℳ = (𝑀, …) and 𝒩 = (𝑁 , …), 𝑆-structures (aka 𝐿-structures);
\item 
  𝑥 = a tuple of variable symbols;
\item
  φ = φ(𝑥), an 𝐿-formula.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Expansion by Constants}\label{expansion-by-constants}

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  A \defn{new constant symbol} for 𝐿 is any symbol not occuring in the alphabet of 𝐿.
\item
  If 𝑐 is a set of new constant symbols, then 𝐿(𝑐) is the \defn{expansion of} 𝐿
  \defn{by new constants} and is defined to be the (uniquely determined) language of
  the signature (𝑪 ∪ 𝑐, 𝑭, 𝑹, ρ).
\item
  Δ(𝑐) is the \defn{expansion of} Δ \defn{by new constants} (from 𝑐, where 𝑐 ∩ Δ
  = ∅) and is defined to be the class of formulas obtained from formulas φ ∈ Δ
  upon substituting (at will) elements from 𝑐 for variables in φ. (``At will''
  indicates that Δ ⊆ Δ(𝑐).)
\item
  \(\mathbf{lt}_{L(M)}:=\) the set of all atomic and negated atomic 𝐿(𝑀)-formulas.
\item
  \(\mathbf{cl}_{L(M)}:=\) the set of all atomic and negated atomic 𝐿(𝑀)-setnences.
\end{enumerate}

% \begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

\subsection{Validity and Truth}\label{validity-and-truth}

\(ℳ \models φ\) means that φ is \defn{valid} in ℳ which means that, for every
tuple 𝑎 from 𝑀 that is at least as long as 𝑥, the 𝐿-sentence φ(𝑎) is \emph{true in} ℳ.

\begin{quote}
\textit{Question}. What is meant by ``φ(𝑎) is true in ℳ?''
\end{quote}

Intuitively, for each 𝑖 we subsitute the element 𝑎 𝑖 for the
variable 𝑥 𝑖 in the formula φ(𝑥), which yields a sentence φ(𝑎) that is
``decidable'' in ℳ. That is, there is a finite procedure by which we can
determine whether or not φ(𝑎) holds (is ``true'') in ℳ.

Formally, however, we may follow a more careful procedure for judging the truth
of a given formula φ in a given structure ℳ. This is the ``simple'' matter of how
syntactically to denote interpretation of variables. As Hodges puts it (in~\cite{Hodges:1993}), this
is ``one of the more irksome parts of model theory.'' The issue is explained
clearly in~\cite[Section 1.4]{Hodges:1993}, so we defer to that treatment:

\begin{quote}
  ``Instead of interpreting a variable symbol as a name of an element 𝑏,
  we can add a new constant for 𝑏 to the signature. The price we pay is that the language
  changes every time another element is named. When constants are added to a
  signature, the new constants and the elements they name are called parameters.\\[6pt]
For example, suppose that 𝒜 is an 𝐿-structure, 𝑎 is a sequence of elements of 𝒜,
and we want to name the elements in 𝑎. Then we choose a sequence 𝑐 of distinct
new constant symbols of the same length as 𝑎, and we form the signature 𝐿(𝑐) by
adding the constants 𝑐 to 𝐿. Then (𝒜 , 𝑎) is an 𝐿(𝑐)-structure and, for each 𝑖,
the element 𝑎 𝑖 is \((𝑐\, i)^{(𝒜, 𝑎)}\), which is the interpretation of 𝑐 𝑖 in
the structure (𝒜 , 𝑎).\\[6pt]
Likewise if ℬ is another 𝐿-structure and 𝑏 a sequence of elements of ℬ of the
same length as 𝑐, then there is an 𝐿(𝑐)-structure (ℬ, 𝑏) in which these same
constants in 𝑐 name the elements of 𝑏. The next lemma is about this situation.
It comes straight out of the definitions and it is often used silently.''
\end{quote}

\begin{lemma}[\protect{\cite[1.4.1]{Hodges:1993}}] Let 𝒜, ℬ be 𝐿-structures and
  suppose (𝒜, 𝑎), (ℬ, 𝑏) are 𝐿(𝑐)-structures. Then a homomorphism 
  ℎ : (𝒜, 𝑎) → (ℬ, 𝑏) is the same thing as a homomorphism ℎ : 𝒜 → ℬ
  such that ℎ ∘ 𝑎 = 𝑏.
\end{lemma}
\begin{remarks*}\
\begin{enumerate}
\item 
  ℎ ∘ 𝑎 denotes the function whose value at 𝑖 is ℎ (𝑎 𝑖);
\item \(φ_x(𝑎)\) denotes [𝑎/𝑥]φ(𝑥) = [𝑎0/𝑥0 , 𝑎1/𝑥1, …]φ(𝑥), which is the sentence
  obtained from φ by substitution: for each 𝑖 replace 𝑥 𝑖 with 𝑎 𝑖.
\item 
  If 𝑡(𝑥) is an 𝐿-term, then \(t^𝒜 (𝑎)\) and \(t(𝑐)^{(𝒜, 𝑎)}\) are the same
  element.
\item
  If φ(𝑥) is an atomic formula then \(𝒜 \models φ_x(𝑎) \; ⇔ \; (𝒜, 𝑐) \models φ_x(𝑐)\).
\end{enumerate}
\end{remarks*}

\section{Models, Theories, Diagrams}\label{models-theories-diagrams}

Let φ ∈ 𝐿₀, ℰ ⊆ 𝐿₀, and let ℳ = (𝑀, …), 𝒩 = (𝑁, …) be 𝐿-structures. Let Δ be an
arbitrary class of formulas (not necessarily from 𝐿).

\subsection{Models}\label{models}

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  If 𝑀 ≠ ∅ and \(ℳ \models ℰ\), then ℳ is a \defn{model} of ℰ; we also say
  ``ℳ \emph{models} ℰ.''
\item
  \(\operatorname{Mod}_L ℰ :=\) the class of 𝐿-structures that model ℰ.
\item
  \(\operatorname{Mod}_L ∅ :=\) the class of all nonempty 𝐿-structures.
\item
  ℰ \defn{entails} φ, denoted ℰ ⊢ φ, just in case every model of ℰ also models φ.
\item
  φ is a \defn{logical consequence} of ℰ just in case ℰ entails φ.
\item
  The \defn{deductive closure} of ℰ is the set \(ℰ^⊢ = \{φ ∈ 𝐿₀ : ℰ ⊢ φ\}\) of
  logical consequences of ℰ.
\item
  ℰ is \defn{deductively closed} provided \(ℰ^⊢ ⊆ ℰ\).
\item
  The sets ℰ₀, ℰ₁ ⊆ 𝐿₀ are ℰ-\defn{equivalent} if \((ℰ ∪ ℰ₀)^⊢ = (ℰ ∪ ℰ₁)^⊢\).
\item
  \defn{logically equivalent} means ∅-equivalent.
\item
  A \defn{contradiction} is an 𝐿-sentence of the form φ ∧ ¬ φ.
\item
  ℰ is \defn{consistent} if \(ℰ^⊢\) contains no contradictions; otherwise, ℰ is
  \defn{inconsistent}.
\end{enumerate}
\begin{remark*}
No model satisfies a contradiction, so the deductive closure of
a contradiction is the set 𝐿₀ of all 𝐿-sentences, and 𝐿₀ is the only deductively
closed inconsistent set of 𝐿-sentences.
\end{remark*}

\subsection{Theories}\label{theories}

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  An 𝐿-\defn{theory} is a \emph{consistent} and \emph{deductively closed} set of
  𝐿-sentences.
\item
  The \defn{cardinality} or \defn{power} of an 𝐿-theory 𝑇 (denoted ∣𝑇∣) is the cardinality of 𝐿.
\item
  \(T_Δ = (T ∩ Δ)^⊢\), the Δ-\defn{part} of the 𝐿-theory 𝑇 (here Δ is an
  arbibtrary class of formulas).
\item
  \(\bfall\) is the class of formulas in which \(\exists\) does not appear;
  \(T_{\bfall} = (T ∩ \bfall)^⊢\),  the \emph{universal part} of 𝑇.
\item
  \(\operatorname{Th}_Δ ℳ := \{φ ∈ 𝐿₀ : φ ∈ Δ, \, ℳ \models φ\}\),
  the set of 𝐿-sentences in Δ that are true in ℳ.
\item
  \(\operatorname{Th} ℳ := \operatorname{Th}_{L_0} ℳ\),
  the set of 𝐿-sentences true in ℳ.
\item
  An 𝐿-theory 𝑇 is \defn{complete} if for all φ ∈ 𝐿₀, either φ ∈ 𝑇 or ¬ φ ∈ 𝑇.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{lemma}[\protect{\cite[3.5.1]{Rothmaler:2000}}] If 𝑇 is an 𝐿-theory, the
  following are equivalent:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
  \item 𝑇 is complete.
  \item 𝑇 is a maximal 𝐿-theory.
  \item 𝑇 is a maximal consistent set of 𝐿-sentences.
  \item 𝑇 = Th ℳ for all \(ℳ \models 𝑇\).
  \item 𝑇 = Th ℳ for some \(ℳ \models 𝑇\).
  \end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{examples*}
\(T^∞\) is the theory of the class of all infinite models of 𝑇, and 𝑇₌ is the \defn{theory of pure identity}, which is the 𝐿₌-theory of all sets (regarded as 𝐿₌-structures). 
\end{examples*}
\subsection{Diagrams}\label{diagrams}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The \defn{diagram} of ℳ is the set \(𝐷(ℳ) := \mathbf{cl}_{𝐿(𝑀)}\) of all
  atomic and negated atomic 𝐿(𝑀)-sentences;
\item
  \(ℳ ⇒_Δ 𝒩\) means ∀ φ ∈ Δ ∩ 𝐿₀ \((ℳ \models φ → 𝒩 \models φ)\).
\item
  ℳ ⇒ 𝒩 means \(ℳ ⇒_𝐿 𝒩\).
\item
  ℳ ≡ 𝒩 means ℳ ⇒ 𝒩 and ℳ ⇐ 𝒩 hold, and this is equivalent to Th ℳ = Th 𝒩.
  We call ℳ and 𝒩 \defn{elementarily equivalent} in this case.
\item
  𝑓 : ℳ ↪ 𝒩 means 𝑓 is an 𝐿-structure-monomorphism from ℳ to 𝒩.
\item
  \(𝑓 : ℳ \stackrel{Δ}{⟶} 𝒩\) means all 𝐿-formulas in Δ are preserved by 𝑓; that
  is, \(ℳ \models φ(𝑎)\) implies \(𝒩 \models φ(𝑓 ∘ 𝑎)\), for all φ ∈ Δ ∩ 𝐿 and all tuples 𝑎 from 𝑀.
\item
  \(𝑓 : ℳ \stackrel{≡}{⟶} 𝒩\) means \(𝑓 : ℳ \stackrel{L}{⟶} 𝒩\).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Some Facts}\label{some-facts}
Let ℳ and 𝒩 be 𝐿-structures and let Δ be a set of 𝐿-formulas.  If 𝑓 : 𝑀 → 𝑁,
then denote by 𝑓[𝑀] the \defn{image} of 𝑀 under 𝑓.
\begin{enumerate}
\item 
  \(f : ℳ \stackrel{\mathbf{at}}{⟶} 𝒩\) iff 𝑓 : ℳ → 𝒩
\item 
 \(f : ℳ \stackrel{Δ}{⟶} 𝒩\) iff \((ℳ, M) \Rrightarrow_{Δ(M)} (𝒩, f[M])\).
\item If \(f : ℳ \stackrel{Δ}{⟶} 𝒩\) and Δ contains \(\mathbf{at}\) and all
  negations of unnested relational atomic formulas, then 𝑓 is a strong
  homomorphism. (The converse is not true.)
\item If \(f : ℳ \stackrel{Δ}{⟶} 𝒩\) and Δ is closed under negation, then
  \(ℳ \models φ(𝑎)\) implies \(𝒩 \models φ(𝑓 ∘ 𝑎)\), for all φ~∈~Δ and tuples 𝑎 from 𝑀.
\item 𝑓 : 𝑀 → 𝑁 is injective iff \(f : ℳ \stackrel{Δ}{⟶} 𝒩\)
for the set \(Δ = \{x \neq y\}\).
\item If Δ ⊆ 𝐿₀, then \(f : ℳ \stackrel{Δ}{⟶} 𝒩\) iff \(ℳ ⇒_Δ 𝒩\) and
𝑓 : 𝑀 → 𝑁.
\item If Δ ⊆ 𝐿₀ and Δ is closed under negation, then \(ℳ ⇒_Δ 𝒩\) implies \(ℳ ≡_Δ 𝒩\).
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{The Lemma on Constants}\label{the-lemma-on-constants}

Above we remarked that if (𝒜, 𝑎) is an 𝐿(𝑐)-structure with 𝒜 an 𝐿-structure,
then for every atomic formula φ of 𝐿, we have \(𝒜 \models φ(𝑎)\) if and only if \((𝒜, 𝑎) \models φ(𝑐)\).

\begin{lemma}[\protect{\cite[2.3.2]{Hodges:1993}}] Let 𝐿 be a language, 𝑇 a
theory in 𝐿, and φ(𝑥) a formula in 𝐿. Let 𝑐 be a sequence of distinct constants
that are not in 𝐿. Then 𝑇 ⊢ φ(𝑐) if and only if 𝑇 ⊢ ∀ 𝑥, φ.
\end{lemma}

\subsection{The Diagram Lemma}\label{the-diagram-lemma}

\begin{lemma}[\protect{\cite[6.1.2]{Rothmaler:2000}}]
  Let ℳ and 𝒩 be 𝐿-structures.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item
    \(𝑓 : ℳ ↪ 𝒩 \, ⇔ \, 𝑓 : ℳ \stackrel{\mathbf{qf}}{⟶} 𝒩
                  \, ⇔ \, (𝒩, 𝑓[M]) \models 𝐷(ℳ)\).\\[6pt]
    In particular, \(f : ℳ \stackrel{≡}{↪} 𝒩  \, ⇒  \, f : ℳ ↪ 𝒩\).\\[-3mm]
  \item
    \(ℳ ↪ 𝒩 \; ⇔ \; 𝒩\) has an 𝐿(𝑀)-expansion that models 𝐷(ℳ).
  \end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\subsection{The Diagram Lemma (ver. 2)}\label{the-diagram-lemma-ver.-2}
Let's consider an alternative version of the Diagram Lemma that makes the role
of new constants more explicit. For this version, we will introduce some 
new notation.

\begin{itemize}
\item 𝑐 is a tuple of distinct symbols not appearing in 𝐿;
\item \(𝑎 : \{0, 1, …, 𝑛-1\} → 𝑀\) and \(𝑏 : \{0, 1, …, 𝑛-1\} → 𝑁\) are 𝑛-tuples in 𝑀 and 𝑁 respectively.
\item (ℳ, 𝑐) and (𝒩, 𝑐) are 𝐿(𝑐)-structures, where \((𝑐 \,i)^ℳ = 𝑎 \, i\) and
  \((𝑐\, i)^𝒩 = 𝑏\, i\) are the interpretations in ℳ and 𝒩 of the new constant
  symbols;
\item
  ⟨ 𝑎 ⟩ is the substructure of ℳ generated by the elements of the tuple 𝑎;
\end{itemize}

\begin{lemma}[\protect{\cite[1.4.2]{Hodges:1993}}] The following are equivalent:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item For every atomic sentence φ(𝑐) of 𝐿(𝑐), if \((ℳ, 𝑐) \models φ(𝑐)\) then \((𝒩, 𝑐)\models φ(𝑐)\). 
  \item There is a homomorphism 𝑓 : ⟨ 𝑎 ⟩ → 𝒩 such that 𝑓 ∘ 𝑎 = 𝑏.
  \item The homomorphism is unique, if it exists, and it is an embedding if and
    only if for every atomic sentence φ of 𝐿(𝑐), we have
    \((ℳ, 𝑐) \models φ \, ⇔ \, (𝒩, 𝑐) \models φ\).
  \end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\section{Elementary equivalence}\label{elementary-equivalence}
\subsection{Isomorphic structures are elementarily equivalent}\label{isomorphic-structures-are-elementarily-equivalent}
\begin{lemma}[\protect{\cite[6.1.3]{Rothmaler:2000}}]
If 𝑓 : ℳ ≅ 𝒩, then \(𝑓 : ℳ \stackrel{≡}{↪} 𝒩\), hence also ℳ ≡ 𝒩.
\end{lemma}
The second implication is \(𝑓 : ℳ \stackrel{≡}{↪} 𝒩\) implies ℳ ≡ 𝒩. 
That's true because, if \(𝑓 : ℳ \stackrel{≡}{↪} 𝒩\), then we have not only
φ ∈ Th ℳ implies φ ∈ Th 𝒩, but also ¬ φ ∈ Th ℳ implies ¬ φ ∈ Th 𝒩. From the
former, ℳ ⇒ 𝒩. From the latter, ℳ ⇐ 𝒩. Thus, ℳ ≡ 𝒩.
(For proof of the first implication, see \cite[page 70]{Rothmaler:2000}.)
The converse of 6.1.3 holds if and only if the structures involved are
finite, as the next proposition shows.

\begin{lemma}[\protect{\cite[8.1.1]{Rothmaler:2000}}]
Let ℳ be an 𝐿-structure. The following are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
\item For every 𝐿-structure 𝒩, 𝒩 ≡ ℳ implies 𝒩 ≅ ℳ.
\item ℳ is finite.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\subsection{All models of a complete theory are elementarily equivalent}\label{all-models-of-a-complete-theory-are-elementarily-equivalent}

\begin{lemma}[\protect{\cite[8.1.2]{Rothmaler:2000}}]
 A theory is complete iff its models are elementarily equivalent.
\end{lemma}

\begin{corollary}[\protect{\cite[8.1.3]{Rothmaler:2000}}]
 A complete theory has a finite model iff it has only one model up to isomorphism.
\end{corollary}

\section{Elementary maps}\label{elementary-maps}
Let ℳ and 𝒩 be 𝐿-structures. A map 𝑓 : 𝑀 → 𝑁 is called \defn{elementary} if
\(f : ℳ \stackrel{≡}{↪} 𝒩\).
The structure ℳ is \defn{elementarily embeddable} in 𝒩, in symbols
\(ℳ \stackrel{≡}{↪} 𝒩\), if there is an elementary map \(f : ℳ \stackrel{≡}{↪} 𝒩\).\\[6pt]
\begin{remarks*}\
\begin{enumerate}
\item
  If \(f : ℳ \stackrel{≡}{↪} 𝒩\), then ℳ ≡ 𝒩.
\item
  While elementary equivalence is weaker than isomorphism, every elementary
  map is automatically an isomorphic embedding
  (by~\cite[Lemma 6.1.2(1)]{Rothmaler:2000}). Therefore, elementary maps are
  aka \defn{elementary embeddings}, and the notation
  \(f : ℳ \stackrel{≡}{↪} 𝒩\) is justified.
\item
  The converse is not true in general, unless the embedding is surjective
  (i.e., an isomorphism), since every isomorphism \(f : ℳ \cong 𝒩\) is an
  elementary map (by~\cite[Prop 6.1.3]{Rothmaler:2000}).
\end{enumerate}
\end{remarks*}

\subsection{Elementary Diagram Lemma}\label{elementary-diagram-lemma}

The \defn{elementary diagram} of an 𝐿-structure ℳ is the complete 𝐿(𝑀)-theory Th(ℳ, 𝑀).

\begin{lemma}[\protect{\cite[8.2.1]{Rothmaler:2000}}]
 Let ℳ and 𝒩 be 𝐿-structures and 𝑓 : 𝑀 → 𝑁.
\begin{enumerate}
\item  𝑓 is elementary ⇔ (ℳ, 𝑀) ≡ (𝒩, 𝑓[𝑀]) ⇔ \((𝒩, 𝑓[𝑀]) \models Th(ℳ, 𝑀)\).
\item \(ℳ \stackrel{≡}{↪} 𝒩\) ⇔ 𝒩 has an expansion that is a model of Th(ℳ, 𝑀).
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}
