### Course Description

**From the course catalog.** Proves the compactness theorem, showing the essential 
finiteness of logical implication. Proves many basic properties of theories, 
showing how the syntactic form of statements influences their behavior with 
respect to different models. Finally, studies properties of elements that cannot 
be stated by a single formula (the type of the element) and shows it can be used 
to characterize certain models.

(A more detailed course description and schedule will appear soon.)

----------------------------------------------------

### Grading Policy
The grades in this course will be based on each student's work on the problem 
sets. Roughly speaking, an A will be assigned to students whose problem sets 
eventually reveal a mastery of the central concepts and theorems of model 
theory; a B will be assigned to students whose work reveals a grasp of the 
basic concepts and a reasonable competence, short of mastery, in putting 
this grasp into play to solve problems.

------------------------------------------------------------------

### Final Exam
As the material is not well-suited to an in-class, 2.5 hour writing effort, 
in place of a final exam there will be a final problem set that may be wider 
in scope than previous problem sets.
