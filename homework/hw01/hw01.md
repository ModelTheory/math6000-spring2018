**(1.5.1)** Given a signature $\sigma$, find a signature $\sigma_1 \supseteq \sigma$ such that all $\sigma$-sturctures $\mathcal M$ and $\mathcal N$ with $\mathcal N \leq \mathcal M$ have expansions $\mathcal{M}'$ and
$\mathcal{N}'$ to $\sigma_1$ such that
$\mathcal{N}'\subseteq \mathcal{M}'$ and
$\operatorname{Aut}\mathcal{M}' = \operatorname{Aut}_{\{N\}}\mathcal{M}$

such that $p_i e = \operatorname{id}_M$ for all $i \in I$.

-------------------------------------------------


Consider the conjecture below (which was inspired by questions asked by Jared Louchs and Connor Meredith).

Suppose we are given two signatures of the following form

$\sigma_0 = (\emptyset, \emptyset, \{r\}, \sigma_0') \quad \text{ and }
\quad  \sigma_1 = (\emptyset, \{f\}, \emptyset, \sigma_1')$

such that $\sigma_0'(r) = \sigma_1'(f)+1$. To ease notation below, let's 
take $\sigma'_1(f) = n$.

($\sigma_0$ might be called a "purely relational" signature, since it has only 
relation symbols; similarly, $\sigma_1$ is "purely algebraic".)

Now, suppose we have structures $\mathbf{P} = (S, r^{\mathbf{P}})$ 
and $\mathbf{L} = (S, f^{\mathbf{L}})$ of types 
$\sigma_0$ and $\sigma_1$ respectively, defined on the same universe, $S$. 
 
Let's make up a new definition that might be useful in this situation.
Let us say that $\mathbf{P}$ is a **proxy** for $\mathbf{L}$
if each of $r^{\mathbf{P}}$ and $f^{\mathbf{L}}$ can be defined in terms the other
as follows: for all $x_0, x_1, \dots, x_{n-1}, y \in S$, 

$f^{\mathbf{L}}(x_0, x_1, \dots, x_{n-1}) = y \quad \Leftrightarrow 
\quad r^{\mathbf{P}}(x_0, x_1, \dots, x_{n-1}, y).$

**EXERCISE.**
Try to prove, or disprove by counterexample, the following 

**Conjecture:** 
If $\mathbf{P} = (S, r^{\mathbf{P}})$ is a **proxy** for $\mathbf{L} = (S, f^{\mathbf{L}})$,
and if $\mathbf{Q} = (T, r^{\mathbf{Q}})$ is a **proxy** for $\mathbf{M} = (T, f^{\mathbf{M}})$,
then a relational homomorphism $h: \mathbf{P} \to \mathbf{Q}$ is *strong* if and only if the 
map $h: S \to T$ is an algebraic homomorphism from $\mathbf{L}$ to $\mathbf{M}$.

**Further food for thought**  
Do you think the notion of "proxy" defined above captures the sense in which the poset we saw in class can be represeted as a semilattice?  If not, think about alternative definitions of "equivalent" structures of different signatures.  This is an open-ended question that may help you get better aquainted with structures and their signatures, but it is not a central theme of the course.  In other words, it's something to think about over dinner.
