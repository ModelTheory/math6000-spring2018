**Exercises:** 2.2.1, 2.2.2, 2.2.3, 2.3.1, 2.3.2, 2.5.1, 2.6.1.

-------------------------------------------------

**2.2.1.** Show that any map $h_0$ from $X$ to an $L$-structure $\mathcal{M}$ can be uniquely extended to a homomorphism $h$ from $\operatorname{Term}_L(X)$ to $\mathcal M$.

-------------------------------------------------

**2.2.2.**  Let $h$ and $h_0$ be as above and let $t(\bar{x})$ be an $L$-term whose variables $\bar{x}$ are in $X$.  Prove that $t^{\mathcal{M}}(h_0[\bar{x}]) = h(t(\bar{x}))$

-------------------------------------------------

**2.2.3.** (About unique legibility) Prove that no proper initial segment of a term (regarded as a string of symbols of the alphabet) can be a term.  Derive that for every term there is a unique way of building it up from its constituents according to the above recursion.


-------------------------------------------------

**2.3.1.** Verify that there are only finitely many nested atomic sentences in $L$, provided the signature of $L$ is finite.

-------------------------------------------------

**2.3.2.** (About unique legibility) Prove that no proper initial segment of a formula (regarded as a string of symbols of the alphabet) can be a formula.  Derive that for every formula there is a unique way of building it up from its constituents according to the above recursion.

**2.5.1.** Find a recursive definition of "free variable" that recurses on the syntactic complexity of the formula under consideration.

---

**2.6.1.** What does the notation $\varphi(y, x)$ mean for a given
$\varphi(x,y) \in L_2$?
